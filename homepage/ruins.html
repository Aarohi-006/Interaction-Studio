      No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank pushing aside the blades which were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes.

      This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high overhead. He was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his pallid eyes and slept, not through weakness of flesh but through determination of will. He knew that this temple was the place required for his invincible intent; he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream.

      The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural. He wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety and impose him on reality. At first, his dreams were chaotic; then in a short while they became dialectic in nature. The stranger dreamed that he was in the center of a circular amphitheater filled with taciturn students; he lectured them on anatomy, cosmography, and magic.

      He understood that modeling the incoherent and vertiginous matter of dreams was the most difficult task that a man could undertake. He swore he would forget the enormous hallucination and sought another method of work. He purified himself, worshiped the planetary gods, pronounced the syllables of a mighty name, and went to sleep. He dreamed almost immediately, with his heart throbbing.

      He dreamed that it was warm, secret, and of a garnet color within the penumbra of a human body. Within a year he had come to the skeleton and the eyelids. He dreamed an entire man. The god of Fire revealed to him that he would magically animate the dreamed phantom so that all creatures would believe him a real man.

      Gradually he sent his son to the other temple. After many years fire surrounded the ruins. He walked toward the sheets of flame. They did not burn him. With relief, with humiliation, with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him.
