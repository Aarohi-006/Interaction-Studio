No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few days there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes. This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high overhead. He was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his pallid eyes and slept, not through weakness of flesh but through determination of will. He knew that this temple was the place required for his invincible intent; he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream.

<!-- RING 2 -->
<text class="r2">
<textPath href="#ring2">
Toward midnight he was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a bird. Tracks of bare feet, some figs and a jug warned him that the men of the region had been spying respectfully on his sleep, soliciting his protection or afraid of his magic. He felt a chill of fear, and sought out a sepulchral niche in the dilapidated wall where he concealed himself among unfamiliar leaves. The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural. He wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety and impose him on reality. This magic project had exhausted the entire expanse of his mind; the rice and fruit they brought him were nourishment enough for his body, which was consecrated to the sole task of sleeping and dreaming.

At first, his dreams were chaotic; then they became dialectic in nature. The stranger dreamed that he was in the center of a circular amphitheater; clouds of taciturn students filled the tiers. The man lectured his pupils on anatomy, cosmography, and magic. Asleep or awake, he thought over the answers of his phantoms and sought a soul worthy of participating in the universe. After nine or ten nights he understood he could expect something only from those who dared oppose him.

<!-- RING 4 -->
<text class="r4">
<textPath href="#ring4">
One afternoon he dismissed the illusory students and kept only one pupil, a taciturn boy. After a catastrophe of insomnia, he understood that modeling the matter of dreams was the most difficult task a man could undertake. He recovered his strength and resumed his work, waiting for the moon’s perfection before dreaming again.

<!-- RING 5 -->
<text class="r5">
<textPath href="#ring5">
He dreamed a warm secret heart and slowly formed a complete man. A god of Fire revealed he would animate the phantom so all would believe him real. The wizard instructed him for years and finally sent him into the world, erasing his memory.

<!-- RING 6 -->
<text class="r6">
<textPath href="#ring6">
When fire consumed the temple, the wizard walked into the flames and understood with relief and terror that he too was an illusion, dreamed by another.
