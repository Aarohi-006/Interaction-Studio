      <p class="node">No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud...</p>
      <p class="node">He knew that this temple was the place required for his invincible intent.</p>
      <p class="node">He knew that his immediate obligation was to dream.</p>

    <div class="ring ring2">
      <p class="node">He wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety and impose him on reality.</p>

      <p class="node">At first, his dreams were chaotic; then they became dialectic in nature.</p>

        With relief, with humiliation, with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him.
