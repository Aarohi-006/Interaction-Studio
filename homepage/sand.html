<h1 class="title">The Book of Sand</h1>

<div class="text">

  <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="1">
    <p class="lead">The short stories of Jorge Luis Borges, written more than twenty years ago, have become classics of contemporary literature.</p>
    <p>Like the distinctive stories in Ficciones and The Aleph, these stories artfully blend many literary genres.</p>
    <p class="spaced">The Book of Sand is an important addition to Borges’ works.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="2">
    <p>At my age (I was born in 1899), I cannot promise more than these variations on favorite themes.</p>
    <p>The volume includes thirteen stories — accidental, or fatal.</p>
    <p class="spaced">I write for myself and for my friends, to ease the passing of time.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="3">
    <p>It was in Cambridge, back in February 1969, that the event took place.</p>
    <p>The river made me think about time — Heraclitus’ millennial image.</p>
    <p class="spaced">I had the impression of having lived that moment once before.</p>
