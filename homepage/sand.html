<h1 class="title">The Book of Sand</h1>

<div class="text">

  <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="1">
    <p class="lead">The short stories of Jorge Luis Borges, written more than twenty years ago, have become classics of contemporary literature. In <em>The Book of Sand</em> are thirteen brand-new stories rivaling those famous stories that established Borges’ worldwide reputation.</p>

    <p>Like the distinctive stories in <em>Ficciones</em> and <em>The Aleph</em>, these stories artfully blend elements from many literary genres: the essay, science fiction, detective fiction, fantasy, literary criticism, and autobiography.</p>

    <p class="spaced"><em>The Book of Sand</em> is an important addition to Borges’ works, a welcome and unexpected gift for his host of admirers.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="2">
    <p>At my age (I was born in 1899), I cannot promise — I cannot even promise myself — more than these few variations on favorite themes. As everyone knows, this is the classic recourse of irreparable monotony.</p>

    <p>The volume includes thirteen stories. The number is accidental, or fatal — here the two words are strictly synonymous — and not magical.</p>

    <p class="spaced">I do not write for a select minority, nor for “The Masses.” I write for myself and for my friends, and I write to ease the passing of time.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="3">
    <p>It was in Cambridge, back in February 1969, that the event took place. I made no attempt to record it at the time, because my initial aim was to forget it.</p>

    <p>The river made me think about time — Heraclitus’ millennial image. Ice floes were borne along on the gray water. Not a soul was in sight.</p>

    <p class="spaced">All at once I had the impression of having lived that moment once before.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="4">
    <p>“Sir,” I said, “are you an Uruguayan or an Argentine?”</p>
    <p>“Argentine, but I’ve lived in Geneva since 1914,” he replied.</p>
    <p class="spaced">Our obvious duty, meanwhile, is to accept the dream just as we accept the world.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 5 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="5">
    <p>The king exchanged a few words with the men of letters who stood around him, then spoke to the bard.</p>

    <p>The bard recited the poem. It consisted of a single line.</p>

    <p class="spaced">“The sin of having known Beauty,” the king whispered.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 6 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="6">
    <p>The reader should be forewarned that the following pages will not be found in the <em>Libellus</em> of Adam of Bremen.</p>

    <p>The poetry of the Urns consists of a single word. To learn that was enough to set out in search of them.</p>

    <p class="spaced">In the course of time I have been many men, but all the while the main thing was the Word.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 7 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="7">
    <p>He took up his harp and uttered the word <em>undr</em>, which means wonder.</p>
    <p>In it I recognized my own verses, the chill of dawn, daybreak over the water, the oars.</p>
    <p class="spaced">“You have understood,” he said.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 8 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="8">
    <p>He called it Utopia, a Greek word meaning there is no such place.</p>

    <p>The road was uneven. Rain began to fall. I saw the light of a house in the distance.</p>

    <p class="spaced">“Facts matter to no one anymore,” he told me.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 9 -->
  <div class="chapter" data-section="9">
    <p>“No one any longer suffers poverty or wealth,” he said. “Everyone has a calling.”</p>

    <p>Outside, the plain was white with silent snow and moonlight.</p>

    <p class="spaced">“Each of us must produce the arts and sciences he needs.”</p>
