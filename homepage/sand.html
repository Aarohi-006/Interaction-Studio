    <h1 class="title">The Book of Sand</h1>

    <div class="block">

<p>The short stories of Jorge Luis Borges, written more than twenty years ago, have become classics of contemporary literature. In <em>The Book of Sand</em> are thirteen brand-new stories rivaling those famous stories that established Borges’ worldwide reputation. Borges himself considered two of the stories — the title story and “The Congress” — among his greatest achievements in short fiction.</p>

<p>Like the distinctive stories in <em>Ficciones</em> and <em>The Aleph</em>, these stories artfully blend elements from many literary genres: the essay, science fiction, detective fiction, fantasy, literary criticism, and autobiography. The subject matter ranges from philosophic musings on the nature of time to deft satire on the role-playing of contemporary authors.</p>

<p><em>The Book of Sand</em> is an important addition to Borges’ works, a welcome and unexpected gift for his host of admirers.</p>

<p>At my age (I was born in 1899), I cannot promise — I cannot even promise myself — more than these few variations on favorite themes. As everyone knows, this is the classic recourse of irreparable monotony. Allow me, nevertheless, to point out one or two details.</p>

<p>The volume includes thirteen stories. The number is accidental, or fatal — here the two words are strictly synonymous — and not magical. If of all my stories I had to save one, I would probably save “The Congress,” which at the same time is the most autobiographical and the most imaginative. Nor shall I hide a predilection for “The Book of Sand.”</p>

<p>I do not write for a select minority, nor for that adulated platonic entity known as “The Masses.” I write for myself and for my friends, and I write to ease the passing of time.</p>

<p>It was in Cambridge, back in February 1969, that the event took place. I made no attempt to record it at the time, because, fearing for my mind, my initial aim was to forget it. Now, some years later, I feel that if I commit it to paper others will read it as a story and, I hope, one day it will become a story for me as well.</p>

<p>The river made me think about time — Heraclitus’ millennial image. Ice floes were borne along on the gray water. Not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p>All at once I had the impression of having lived that moment once before. Someone had sat down at the other end of the bench. The melody he tried to whistle took me back to a Buenos Aires patio that has long since disappeared.</p>

<p>“Sir,” I said, “are you an Uruguayan or an Argentine?”</p>

<p>“Argentine, but I’ve lived in Geneva since 1914,” he replied.</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“In that case,” I said, “your name is Jorge Luis Borges. I, too, am Jorge Luis Borges. This is 1969 and we’re in Cambridge.”</p>

<p>He answered, “No. I’m here in Geneva. The strange thing is that we resemble each other, but you’re much older and your hair is gray.”</p>

<p>Our obvious duty, meanwhile, is to accept the dream just as we accept the world and being born and seeing and breathing.</p>

<p>“My dream has lasted seventy years now,” I said. “There isn’t a person alive who, on waking, does not find himself with himself.”</p>

<p>The king exchanged a few words with the men of letters who stood around him, then spoke to the bard. “Your first ode was an apt compendium of all that has been sung in Ireland. This one outdoes whatever came before it. It astounds, it dazzles, it causes wonderment.”</p>

<p>The bard recited the poem. It consisted of a single line. Not venturing to repeat it aloud, the poet and his king savored it as if it were a secret prayer or a blasphemy.</p>

<p>“The sin of having known Beauty,” the king whispered, “which is a gift forbidden to men.”</p>

<p>Of the poet we know that he killed himself upon leaving the palace; of the king, that he became a beggar wandering the length and breadth of Ireland, which was once his kingdom.</p>

<p>The reader should be forewarned that the following pages will not be found in the <em>Libellus</em> of Adam of Bremen. They were unearthed in a manuscript in Oxford and published as a curiosity.</p>

<p>The poetry of the Urns consists of a single word. To learn that was enough to set out in search of them and the way that would lead to their land.</p>

<p>I was an oarsman, slave, woodcutter, singer, and taster of deep waters and metals. I suffered captivity and fought in distant lands. In the course of time I have been many men, but all the while the main thing was the Word.</p>

<p>He took up his harp and uttered the word <em>undr</em>, which means wonder. In it I recognized my own verses, the chill of dawn, daybreak over the water, the oars.</p>

<p>“You have understood,” he said.</p>

<p>He called it Utopia, a Greek word meaning there is no such place.</p>

<p>The road was uneven. Rain began to fall. I saw the light of a house in the distance. The door was opened by a man dressed in gray who seemed to be waiting for someone.</p>

<p>“We receive such visits from century to century,” he said. “They don’t last long. Tomorrow, at the latest, you’ll be home again.”</p>

<p>“Facts matter to no one anymore,” he told me. “They are mere points of departure for invention and reasoning. We live in time, but we try to live under the aspect of eternity.”</p>

<p>“No one any longer suffers poverty or wealth,” he said. “Everyone has a calling.”</p>

<p>“Having reached a hundred, a person no longer needs love or friendship. When he wishes, he kills himself. Man is master of his life. He is also master of his death.”</p>

<p>Outside, the plain was white with silent snow and moonlight.</p>

<p>“Then everyone must be his own Bernard Shaw, his own Christ, his own Archimedes,” I said.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Each of us must produce the arts and sciences he needs.”</p>
