      <!-- The  short  stories  of  Jorge  Luis  Borges,  written 
more  than  twenty  years  ago,  have  become 
classics  of  contemporary  literature.  In  The 
Book  of  Sand  are  thirteen  brand-new  stories 
rivaling  those  famous  stories  that  established 
Borges'  world-wide  reputation.  Borges  him- 
self considers  two  of  the  stories— the  title 
story  and  "The  Congress"— to  be  among  his 
greatest  achievements  in  short  fiction. 

Like  the  distinctive  stories  in  Ficciones  and 
The  Aleph,  these  stories  artfully  blend  ele- 
ments from  many  literary  genres:  the  essay, 
science  fiction,  detective  fiction,  fantasy,  lit- 
erary criticism  and  autobiography.  The  sub- 
ject matter,  which  Borges  makes  so  uniquely 
his  own,  ranges  from  philosophic  musings  on 
the  nature  of  time  to  deft  satire  on  the 
role-playing  of  contemporary  authors. 

The  Book  of  Sand  is  an  important  addition 
to  Borges'  works,  a  welcome  and  unexpected 
gift  for  Borges'  host  of  admirers.

Author's  Note 


At  my  age  (I  was  born  in  1899),  I  cannot 
promise — I  cannot  even  promise  myself — more 
than  these  few  variations  on  favorite  themes.  As 
everyone  knows,  this  is  the  classic  recourse  of  ir- 
reparable monotony.  Allow  me,  nevertheless,  to 
point  out  one  or  two  details. 

The  volume  includes  thirteen  stories.  The 
number  is  accidental,  or  fatal — here  the  two  words 
are  strictly  synonymous — and  not  magical.  If  of  all 
my  stories  I  had  to  save  one,  I  would  probably 
save  "The  Congress,"  which  at  the  same  time  is  the 
most  autobiographical  (the  one  richest  in  memo- 
ries) and  the  most  imaginative.  Nor  shall  I  hide  a 
predilection  for  "The  Book  of  Sand."  There  is  also 
a  love  story,  a  "psychological"  story,  and  the  story 
of  a  dramatic  episode  in  South  American  history. 

In  these  blind  man's  exercises,  I  have  tried  to  be 
faithful  to  the  example  of  H.  G.  Wells  in  combin- 
ing a  plain  and  at  times  almost  colloquial  style 
with  a  fantastic  plot.  To  Wells'  name  the  reader 
may  add  those  of  Swift  and  of  Poe,  who,  around 
1838,    gave    up    a    very    rich    style    in    order    to 


bequeath  us  the  admirable  final  chapters  of  his 
Narrative  of  Arthur  Gordon  Pym. 

I  do  not  write  for  a  select  minority,  which  means 
nothing  to  me,  nor  for  that  adulated  platonic  en- 
tity known  as  "The  Masses."  Both  abstractions,  so 
dear  to  the  demagogue,  I  disbelieve  in.  I  write  for 
myself  and  for  my  friends,  and  I  write  to  ease  the 
passing  of  time.

The  Other 


It  was  in  Cambridge,  back  in  February,  1969,  that 
the  event  took  place.  I  made  no  attempt  to  record 
it  at  the  time,  because,  fearing  for  my  mind,  my 
initial  aim  was  to  forget  it.  Now,  some  years  later,  I 
feel  that  if  I  commit  it  to  paper  others  will  read  it 
as  a  story  and,  I  hope,  one  day  it  will  become  a 
story  for  me  as  well.  I  know  it  was  horrifying  while 
it  lasted — and  even  more  so  during  the  sleepless 
nights  that  followed — but  this  does  not  mean  that 
an  account  of  it  will  necessarily  move  anyone  else. 

It  was  about  ten  o'clock  in  the  morning.  I  sat  on 
a  bench  facing  the  Charles  River.  Some  five 
hundred  yards  distant,  on  my  right,  rose  a  tall 
building  whose  name  I  never  knew.  Ice  floes  were 
borne  along  on  the  gray  water.  Inevitably,  the 
river  made  me  think  about  time — Heraclitus'  mil- 
lennial image.  I  had  slept  well;  my  class  on  the  pre- 
vious afternoon  had,  I  thought,  managed  to  hold 
the  interest  of  my  students.  Not  a  soul  was  in  sight. 

All  at  once,  I  had  the  impression  (according  to 
psychologists,  it  corresponds  to  a  state  of  fatigue) 
of  having  lived  that  moment  once  before.  Some- 


1 1 


one  had  sat  down  at  the  other  end  of  the  bench.  I 
would  have  preferred  to  be  alone,  but  not  wish- 
ing to  appear  unsociable  I  avoided  getting  up 
abruptly.  The  other  man  had  begun  to  whistle.  It 
was  then  that  the  first  of  the  many  disquieting 
things  of  that  morning  occurred.  What  he  whis- 
tled, what  he  tried  to  whistle  (I  have  no  ear  for 
music),  was  the  tune  of  "La  tapera,"  an  old 
milonga  by  Elias  Regules.  The  melody  took  me 
back  to  a  certain  Buenos  Aires  patio,  which  has 
long  since  disappeared,  and  to  the  memory  of  my 
cousin  Alvaro  Melian  Lafinur,  who  has  been  dead 
for  so  many  years.  Then  came  the  words.  They 
were  those  of  the  opening  line.  It  was  not  Alvaro's 
voice  but  an  imitation  of  it.  Recognizing  this,  I  was 
taken  aback. 

"Sir,"  I  said,  turning  to  the  other  man,  "are  you 
an  Uruguayan  or  an  Argentine?" 

"Argentine,  but  I've  lived  in  Geneva  since 
1914,"  he  replied. 

There  was  a  long  silence.  "At  number  seventeen 
Malagnou — across  from  the  Orthodox  church?"  I 
asked. 

He  answered  in  the  affirmative. 

"In  that  case,"  I  said  straight  out,  "your  name  is 
Jorge  Luis  Borges.  I,  too,  am  Jorge  Luis  Borges. 
This  is  1969  and  we're  in  the  city  of  Cambridge." 

"No,"  he  said  in  a  voice  that  was  mine  but  a  bit 
removed.  He  paused,  then  became  insistent.  "I'm 
here  in  Geneva,  on  a  bench,  a  few  steps  from  the 
Rhone.  The  strange  thing  is  that  we  resemble  each 
other,  but  you're  much  older  and  your  hair  is 
gray." 

"I  can  prove  I'm  not  lying,"  I  said.  "I'm  going  to 
tell  you  things  a  stranger  couldn't  possibly  know.

At  home  we  have  a  silver  mate  cup  with  a  base  in 
the  form  of  entwined  serpents.  Our  great-grand- 
father brought  it  from  Peru.  There's  also  a  silver 
washbasin  that  hung  from  his  saddle.  In  the  ward- 
robe of  your  room  are  two  rows  of  books:  the 
three  volumes  of  Lane's  Thousand  and  One 
Nights,  with  steel  engravings  and  with  notes  in 
small  type  at  the  end  of  each  chapter;  Quicherat's 
Latin  dictionary;  Tacitus'  Germania  in  Latin  and 
also  in  Gordon's  English  translation;  a  Don  Quixote 
published  by  Gamier;  Rivera  Indarte's  Tabids  de 
Sangre,  inscribed  by  the  author;  Carlyle's  Sartor 
Resartus;  a  biography  of  Amiel;  and,  hidden  be- 
hind the  other  volumes,  a  book  in  paper  covers 
about  sexual  customs  in  the  Balkans.  Nor  have  I 
forgotten  one  evening  on  a  certain  second  floor  of 
the  Place  Dubourg." 

"Dufour,"  he  corrected. 

"Very  well — Dufour.  Is  this  enough  now?" 

"No,"  he  said.  "These  proofs  prove  nothing.  If  I 
am  dreaming  you,  it's  natural  that  you  know  what 
I  know.  Your  catalog,  for  all  its  length,  is  com- 
pletely worthless." 

His  objection  was  to  the  point.  I  said,  "If  this 
morning  and  this  meeting  are  dreams,  each  of  us 
has  to  believe  that  he  is  the  dreamer.  Perhaps  we 
have  stopped  dreaming,  perhaps  not.  Our  obvious 
duty,  meanwhile,  is  to  accept  the  dream  just  as  we 
accept  the  world  and  being  born  and  seeing  and 
breathing." 

"And  if  the  dream  should  go  on?"  he  said  anx- 
iously. 

To  calm  him  and  to  calm  myself,  I  feigned  an 
air  of  assurance  that  I  certainly  did  not  feel.  "My 
dream  has  lasted  seventy  years  now,"  I  said.  "After 


»3 


all,  there  isn't  a  person  alive  who,  on  waking,  does 
not  find  himself  with  himself.  It's  what  is  happen- 
ing to  us  now — except  that  we  are  two.  Don't  you 
want  to  know  something  of  my  past,  which  is  the 
future  awaiting  you?" 

He  assented  without  a  word.  I  went  on,  a  bit 
lost.  "Mother  is  healthy  and  well  in  her  house  on 
Charcas  and  Maipti,  in  Buenos  Aires,  but  Father 
died  some  thirty  years  ago.  He  died  of  heart 
trouble.  Hemiplegia  finished  him;  his  left  hand, 
placed  on  his  right,  was  like  the  hand  of  a  child  on 
a  giant's.  He  died  impatient  for  death  but  without 
complaint.  Our  grandmother  had  died  in  the  same 
house.  A  few  days  before  the  end,  she  called  us  all 
together  and  said,  'I'm  an  old  woman  who  is  dying 
very,  very  slowly.  Don't  anyone  become  upset 
about  such  a  common,  everyday  thing.'  Your  sis- 
ter, Norah,  married  and  has  two  sons.  By  the  way, 
how  is  everyone  at  home?" 

"Quite  well.  Father  makes  his  same  antireligious 
jokes.  Last  night  he  said  that  Jesus  was  like  the 
gauchos,  who  don't  like  to  commit  themselves,  and 
that's  why  he  preached  in  parables."  He  hesitated 
and  then  said,  "And  you?" 

"I  don't  know  the  number  of  books  you'll  write, 
but  I  know  they'll  be  too  many.  You'll  write  poems 
that  will  give  you  a  pleasure  that  others  won't  share 
and  stories  of  a  somewhat  fantastic  nature.  Like 
your  father  and  so  many  others  of  our  family,  you 
will  teach." 

It  pleased  me  that  he  did  not  ask  about  the  suc- 
cess or  failure  of  his  books.  I  changed  my  tone  and 
went  on.  "As  for  history,  there  was  another  war, 
almost  among  the  same  antagonists.  France  was 
not    long    in    caving    in;    England    and    America

an  account  of  it  will  necessarily  move  anyone  else. 

It  was  about  ten  o'clock  in  the  morning.  I  sat  on 
a  bench  facing  the  Charles  River.  Some  five 
hundred  yards  distant,  on  my  right,  rose  a  tall 
building  whose  name  I  never  knew.  Ice  floes  were 
borne  along  on  the  gray  water.  Inevitably,  the 
river  made  me  think  about  time — Heraclitus'  mil- 
lennial image.  I  had  slept  well;  my  class  on  the  pre- 
vious afternoon  had,  I  thought,  managed  to  hold 
the  interest  of  my  students.  Not  a  soul  was  in  sight. 

All  at  once,  I  had  the  impression  (according  to 
psychologists,  it  corresponds  to  a  state  of  fatigue) 
of  having  lived  that  moment  once  before.  Some-

one  had  sat  down  at  the  other  end  of  the  bench.  I 
would  have  preferred  to  be  alone,  but  not  wish- 
ing to  appear  unsociable  I  avoided  getting  up 
abruptly.  The  other  man  had  begun  to  whistle.  It 
was  then  that  the  first  of  the  many  disquieting 
things  of  that  morning  occurred.  What  he  whis- 
tled, what  he  tried  to  whistle  (I  have  no  ear  for 
music),  was  the  tune  of  "La  tapera,"  an  old 
milonga  by  Elias  Regules.  The  melody  took  me 
back  to  a  certain  Buenos  Aires  patio,  which  has 
long  since  disappeared,  and  to  the  memory  of  my 
cousin  Alvaro  Melian  Lafinur,  who  has  been  dead 
for  so  many  years.  Then  came  the  words.  They 
were  those  of  the  opening  line.  It  was  not  Alvaro's 
voice  but  an  imitation  of  it.  Recognizing  this,  I  was 
taken  aback. 

"Sir,"  I  said,  turning  to  the  other  man,  "are  you 
an  Uruguayan  or  an  Argentine?" 

"Argentine,  but  I've  lived  in  Geneva  since 
1914,"  he  replied. 

There  was  a  long  silence.  "At  number  seventeen 
Malagnou — across  from  the  Orthodox  church?"  I 
asked. 

He  answered  in  the  affirmative. 

"In  that  case,"  I  said  straight  out,  "your  name  is 
Jorge  Luis  Borges.  I,  too,  am  Jorge  Luis  Borges. 
This  is  1969  and  we're  in  the  city  of  Cambridge." 

"No,"  he  said  in  a  voice  that  was  mine  but  a  bit 
removed.  He  paused,  then  became  insistent.  "I'm 
here  in  Geneva,  on  a  bench,  a  few  steps  from  the 
Rhone.  The  strange  thing  is  that  we  resemble  each 
other,  but  you're  much  older  and  your  hair  is 
gray." 

"I  can  prove  I'm  not  lying,"  I  said.  "I'm  going  to 
tell  you  things  a  stranger  couldn't  possibly  know.

At  home  we  have  a  silver  mate  cup  with  a  base  in 
the  form  of  entwined  serpents.  Our  great-grand- 
father brought  it  from  Peru.  There's  also  a  silver 
washbasin  that  hung  from  his  saddle.  In  the  ward- 
robe of  your  room  are  two  rows  of  books:  the 
three  volumes  of  Lane's  Thousand  and  One 
Nights,  with  steel  engravings  and  with  notes  in 
small  type  at  the  end  of  each  chapter;  Quicherat's 
Latin  dictionary;  Tacitus'  Germania  in  Latin  and 
also  in  Gordon's  English  translation;  a  Don  Quixote 
published  by  Gamier;  Rivera  Indarte's  Tabids  de 
Sangre,  inscribed  by  the  author;  Carlyle's  Sartor 
Resartus;  a  biography  of  Amiel;  and,  hidden  be- 
hind the  other  volumes,  a  book  in  paper  covers 
about  sexual  customs  in  the  Balkans.  Nor  have  I 
forgotten  one  evening  on  a  certain  second  floor  of 
the  Place  Dubourg." 

"Dufour,"  he  corrected. 

"Very  well — Dufour.  Is  this  enough  now?" 

"No,"  he  said.  "These  proofs  prove  nothing.  If  I 
am  dreaming  you,  it's  natural  that  you  know  what 
I  know.  Your  catalog,  for  all  its  length,  is  com- 
pletely worthless." 

His  objection  was  to  the  point.  I  said,  "If  this 
morning  and  this  meeting  are  dreams,  each  of  us 
has  to  believe  that  he  is  the  dreamer.  Perhaps  we 
have  stopped  dreaming,  perhaps  not.  Our  obvious 
duty,  meanwhile,  is  to  accept  the  dream  just  as  we 
accept  the  world  and  being  born  and  seeing  and 
breathing." 

"And  if  the  dream  should  go  on?"  he  said  anx- 
iously. 

To  calm  him  and  to  calm  myself,  I  feigned  an 
air  of  assurance  that  I  certainly  did  not  feel.  "My 
dream  has  lasted  seventy  years  now,"  I  said.  "After

all,  there  isn't  a  person  alive  who,  on  waking,  does 
not  find  himself  with  himself.  It's  what  is  happen- 
ing to  us  now — except  that  we  are  two.  Don't  you 
want  to  know  something  of  my  past,  which  is  the 
future  awaiting  you?" 

He  assented  without  a  word.  I  went  on,  a  bit 
lost.  "Mother  is  healthy  and  well  in  her  house  on 
Charcas  and  Maipti,  in  Buenos  Aires,  but  Father 
died  some  thirty  years  ago.  He  died  of  heart 
trouble.  Hemiplegia  finished  him;  his  left  hand, 
placed  on  his  right,  was  like  the  hand  of  a  child  on 
a  giant's.  He  died  impatient  for  death  but  without 
complaint.  Our  grandmother  had  died  in  the  same 
house.  A  few  days  before  the  end,  she  called  us  all 
together  and  said,  'I'm  an  old  woman  who  is  dying 
very,  very  slowly.  Don't  anyone  become  upset 
about  such  a  common,  everyday  thing.'  Your  sis- 
ter, Norah,  married  and  has  two  sons.  By  the  way, 
how  is  everyone  at  home?" 

"Quite  well.  Father  makes  his  same  antireligious 
jokes.  Last  night  he  said  that  Jesus  was  like  the 
gauchos,  who  don't  like  to  commit  themselves,  and 
that's  why  he  preached  in  parables."  He  hesitated 
and  then  said,  "And  you?" 

"I  don't  know  the  number  of  books  you'll  write, 
but  I  know  they'll  be  too  many.  You'll  write  poems 
that  will  give  you  a  pleasure  that  others  won't  share 
and  stories  of  a  somewhat  fantastic  nature.  Like 
your  father  and  so  many  others  of  our  family,  you 
will  teach." 

It  pleased  me  that  he  did  not  ask  about  the  suc- 
cess or  failure  of  his  books.  I  changed  my  tone  and 
went  on.  "As  for  history,  there  was  another  war, 
almost  among  the  same  antagonists.  France  was 
not    long    in    caving    in;    England    and    America
