  const fullText = `The  short  stories  of  Jorge  Luis  Borges,  written 
more  than  twenty  years  ago,  have  become 
classics  of  contemporary  literature.  In  The 
Book  of  Sand  are  thirteen  brand-new  stories 
rivaling  those  famous  stories  that  established 
Borges'  world-wide  reputation.  Borges  him- 
self considers  two  of  the  stories— the  title 
story  and  "The  Congress"— to  be  among  his 
greatest  achievements  in  short  fiction. 

Like  the  distinctive  stories  in  Ficciones  and 
The  Aleph,  these  stories  artfully  blend  ele- 
ments from  many  literary  genres:  the  essay, 
science  fiction,  detective  fiction,  fantasy,  lit- 
erary criticism  and  autobiography.  The  sub- 
ject matter,  which  Borges  makes  so  uniquely 
his  own,  ranges  from  philosophic  musings  on 
the  nature  of  time  to  deft  satire  on  the 
role-playing  of  contemporary  authors. 

The  Book  of  Sand  is  an  important  addition 
to  Borges'  works,  a  welcome  and  unexpected 
gift  for  Borges'  host  of  admirers.

Author's  Note 


At  my  age  (I  was  born  in  1899),  I  cannot 
promise — I  cannot  even  promise  myself — more 
than  these  few  variations  on  favorite  themes.  As 
everyone  knows,  this  is  the  classic  recourse  of  ir- 
reparable monotony.  Allow  me,  nevertheless,  to 
point  out  one  or  two  details. 

The  volume  includes  thirteen  stories.  The 
number  is  accidental,  or  fatal — here  the  two  words 
are  strictly  synonymous — and  not  magical.  If  of  all 
my  stories  I  had  to  save  one,  I  would  probably 
save  "The  Congress,"  which  at  the  same  time  is  the 
most  autobiographical  (the  one  richest  in  memo- 
ries) and  the  most  imaginative.  Nor  shall  I  hide  a 
predilection  for  "The  Book  of  Sand."  There  is  also 
a  love  story,  a  "psychological"  story,  and  the  story 
of  a  dramatic  episode  in  South  American  history. 

In  these  blind  man's  exercises,  I  have  tried  to  be 
faithful  to  the  example  of  H.  G.  Wells  in  combin- 
ing a  plain  and  at  times  almost  colloquial  style 
with  a  fantastic  plot.  To  Wells'  name  the  reader 
may  add  those  of  Swift  and  of  Poe,  who,  around 
1838,    gave    up    a    very    rich    style    in    order    to 


bequeath  us  the  admirable  final  chapters  of  his 
Narrative  of  Arthur  Gordon  Pym. 

I  do  not  write  for  a  select  minority,  which  means 
nothing  to  me,  nor  for  that  adulated  platonic  en- 
tity known  as  "The  Masses."  Both  abstractions,  so 
dear  to  the  demagogue,  I  disbelieve  in.  I  write  for 
myself  and  for  my  friends,  and  I  write  to  ease  the 
passing  of  time.

The  Other 


It  was  in  Cambridge,  back  in  February,  1969,  that 
the  event  took  place.  I  made  no  attempt  to  record 
it  at  the  time,  because,  fearing  for  my  mind,  my 
initial  aim  was  to  forget  it.  Now,  some  years  later,  I 
feel  that  if  I  commit  it  to  paper  others  will  read  it 
as  a  story  and,  I  hope,  one  day  it  will  become  a 
story  for  me  as  well.  I  know  it  was  horrifying  while 
it  lasted — and  even  more  so  during  the  sleepless 
nights  that  followed — but  this  does  not  mean  that 
an  account  of  it  will  necessarily  move  anyone  else. 

It  was  about  ten  o'clock  in  the  morning.  I  sat  on 
a  bench  facing  the  Charles  River.  Some  five 
hundred  yards  distant,  on  my  right,  rose  a  tall 
building  whose  name  I  never  knew.  Ice  floes  were 
borne  along  on  the  gray  water.  Inevitably,  the 
river  made  me  think  about  time — Heraclitus'  mil- 
lennial image.  I  had  slept  well;  my  class  on  the  pre- 
vious afternoon  had,  I  thought,  managed  to  hold 
the  interest  of  my  students.  Not  a  soul  was  in  sight. 

All  at  once,  I  had  the  impression  (according  to 
psychologists,  it  corresponds  to  a  state  of  fatigue) 
of  having  lived  that  moment  once  before.  Some- 


1 1 


one  had  sat  down  at  the  other  end  of  the  bench.  I 
would  have  preferred  to  be  alone,  but  not  wish- 
ing to  appear  unsociable  I  avoided  getting  up 
abruptly.  The  other  man  had  begun  to  whistle.  It 
was  then  that  the  first  of  the  many  disquieting 
things  of  that  morning  occurred.  What  he  whis- 
tled, what  he  tried  to  whistle  (I  have  no  ear  for 
music),  was  the  tune  of  "La  tapera,"  an  old 
milonga  by  Elias  Regules.  The  melody  took  me 
back  to  a  certain  Buenos  Aires  patio,  which  has 
long  since  disappeared,  and  to  the  memory  of  my 
cousin  Alvaro  Melian  Lafinur,  who  has  been  dead 
for  so  many  years.  Then  came  the  words.  They 
were  those  of  the  opening  line.  It  was  not  Alvaro's 
voice  but  an  imitation  of  it.  Recognizing  this,  I  was 
taken  aback. 

"Sir,"  I  said,  turning  to  the  other  man,  "are  you 
an  Uruguayan  or  an  Argentine?" 

"Argentine,  but  I've  lived  in  Geneva  since 
1914,"  he  replied. 

There  was  a  long  silence.  "At  number  seventeen 
Malagnou — across  from  the  Orthodox  church?"  I 
asked. 

He  answered  in  the  affirmative. 

"In  that  case,"  I  said  straight  out,  "your  name  is 
Jorge  Luis  Borges.  I,  too,  am  Jorge  Luis  Borges. 
This  is  1969  and  we're  in  the  city  of  Cambridge." 

"No,"  he  said  in  a  voice  that  was  mine  but  a  bit 
removed.  He  paused,  then  became  insistent.  "I'm 
here  in  Geneva,  on  a  bench,  a  few  steps  from  the 
Rhone.  The  strange  thing  is  that  we  resemble  each 
other,  but  you're  much  older  and  your  hair  is 
gray." 

"I  can  prove  I'm  not  lying,"  I  said.  "I'm  going  to 
tell  you  things  a  stranger  couldn't  possibly  know.

At  home  we  have  a  silver  mate  cup  with  a  base  in 
the  form  of  entwined  serpents.  Our  great-grand- 
father brought  it  from  Peru.  There's  also  a  silver 
washbasin  that  hung  from  his  saddle.  In  the  ward- 
robe of  your  room  are  two  rows  of  books:  the 
three  volumes  of  Lane's  Thousand  and  One 
Nights,  with  steel  engravings  and  with  notes  in 
small  type  at  the  end  of  each  chapter;  Quicherat's 
Latin  dictionary;  Tacitus'  Germania  in  Latin  and 
also  in  Gordon's  English  translation;  a  Don  Quixote 
published  by  Gamier;  Rivera  Indarte's  Tabids  de 
Sangre,  inscribed  by  the  author;  Carlyle's  Sartor 
Resartus;  a  biography  of  Amiel;  and,  hidden  be- 
hind the  other  volumes,  a  book  in  paper  covers 
about  sexual  customs  in  the  Balkans.  Nor  have  I 
forgotten  one  evening  on  a  certain  second  floor  of 
the  Place  Dubourg." 

"Dufour,"  he  corrected. 

"Very  well — Dufour.  Is  this  enough  now?" 

"No,"  he  said.  "These  proofs  prove  nothing.  If  I 
am  dreaming  you,  it's  natural  that  you  know  what 
I  know.  Your  catalog,  for  all  its  length,  is  com- 
pletely worthless." 

His  objection  was  to  the  point.  I  said,  "If  this 
morning  and  this  meeting  are  dreams,  each  of  us 
has  to  believe  that  he  is  the  dreamer.  Perhaps  we 
have  stopped  dreaming,  perhaps  not.  Our  obvious 
duty,  meanwhile,  is  to  accept  the  dream  just  as  we 
accept  the  world  and  being  born  and  seeing  and 
breathing." 

"And  if  the  dream  should  go  on?"  he  said  anx- 
iously. 

To  calm  him  and  to  calm  myself,  I  feigned  an 
air  of  assurance  that  I  certainly  did  not  feel.  "My 
dream  has  lasted  seventy  years  now,"  I  said.  "After 


»3 


all,  there  isn't  a  person  alive  who,  on  waking,  does 
not  find  himself  with  himself.  It's  what  is  happen- 
ing to  us  now — except  that  we  are  two.  Don't  you 
want  to  know  something  of  my  past,  which  is  the 
future  awaiting  you?" 

He  assented  without  a  word.  I  went  on,  a  bit 
lost.  "Mother  is  healthy  and  well  in  her  house  on 
Charcas  and  Maipti,  in  Buenos  Aires,  but  Father 
died  some  thirty  years  ago.  He  died  of  heart 
trouble.  Hemiplegia  finished  him;  his  left  hand, 
placed  on  his  right,  was  like  the  hand  of  a  child  on 
a  giant's.  He  died  impatient  for  death  but  without 
complaint.  Our  grandmother  had  died  in  the  same 
house.  A  few  days  before  the  end,  she  called  us  all 
together  and  said,  'I'm  an  old  woman  who  is  dying 
very,  very  slowly.  Don't  anyone  become  upset 
about  such  a  common,  everyday  thing.'  Your  sis- 
ter, Norah,  married  and  has  two  sons.  By  the  way, 
how  is  everyone  at  home?" 

"Quite  well.  Father  makes  his  same  antireligious 
jokes.  Last  night  he  said  that  Jesus  was  like  the 
gauchos,  who  don't  like  to  commit  themselves,  and 
that's  why  he  preached  in  parables."  He  hesitated 
and  then  said,  "And  you?" 

"I  don't  know  the  number  of  books  you'll  write, 
but  I  know  they'll  be  too  many.  You'll  write  poems 
that  will  give  you  a  pleasure  that  others  won't  share 
and  stories  of  a  somewhat  fantastic  nature.  Like 
your  father  and  so  many  others  of  our  family,  you 
will  teach." 

It  pleased  me  that  he  did  not  ask  about  the  suc- 
cess or  failure  of  his  books.  I  changed  my  tone  and 
went  on.  "As  for  history,  there  was  another  war, 
almost  among  the  same  antagonists.  France  was 
not    long    in    caving    in;    England    and    America 


H 


fought  against  a  German  dictator  named  Hitler — 
the  cyclical  battle  of  Waterloo.  Around  1946, 
Buenos  Aires  gave  birth  to  another  Rosas,  who 
bore  a  fair  resemblance  to  our  kinsman.  In  1955, 
the  province  of  Cordoba  came  to  our  rescue,  as 
Entre  Rios  had  in  the  last  century.  Now  things  are 
going  badly.  Russia  is  taking  over  the  world; 
America,  hampered  by  the  superstition  of  democ- 
racy, can't  make  up  its  mind  to  become  an  empire. 
With  every  day  that  passes,  our  country  becomes 
more  provincial.  More  provincial  and  more  pre- 
tentious— as  if  its  eyes  were  closed.  It  wouldn't  sur- 
prise me  if  the  teaching  of  Latin  in  our  schools 
were  replaced  by  that  of  Guarani." 

I  could  tell  that  he  was  barely  paying  attention. 
The  elemental  fear  of  what  is  impossible  and  yet 
what  is  so  dismayed  him.  I,  who  have  never  been  a 
father,  felt  for  that  poor  boy — more  intimate  to 
me  even  than  a  son  of  my  flesh — a  surge  of  love. 
Seeing  that  he  clutched  a  book  in  his  hands,  I 
asked  what  it  was. 

"The  Possessed,  or,  as  I  believe,  The  Devils,  by 
Fedor  Dostoevski,"  he  answered,  not  without  van- 
ity. 

"It  has  faded  in  my  memory.  What's  it  like?"  As 
soon  as  I  said  this,  I  felt  that  the  question  was  a 
blasphemy. 

"The  Russian  master,"  he  pronounced,  "has 
seen  better  than  anyone  else  into  the  labyrinth  of 
the  Slavic  soul." 

This  attempt  at  rhetoric  seemed  to  me  proof 
that  he  had  regained  his  composure.  I  asked  what 
other  volumes  of  the  master  he  had  read.  He  men- 
tioned two  or  three,  among  them  The  Doable.  I 
then    asked    him    if  on    reading   them    he    could 


!5 


clearly  distinguish  the  characters,  as  you  could  in 
Joseph  Conrad,  and  if  he  thought  of  going  on  in 
his  study  of  Dostoevski's  work. 

"Not  really,"  he  said  with  a  certain  surprise. 

I  asked  what  he  was  writing  and  he  told  me  he 
was  putting  together  a  book  of  poems  that  would 
be  called  Red  Hymns.  He  said  he  had  also  consid- 
ered calling  it  Red  Rhythms. 

"And  why  not?"  I  said.  "You  can  cite  good  ante- 
cedents. Ruben  Dario's  blue  verse  and  Verlaine's 
gray  song." 

Ignoring  this,  he  explained  that  his  book  would 
celebrate  the  brotherhood  of  man.  The  poet  of 
our  time  could  not  turn  his  back  on  his  own  age, 
he  went  on  to  say.  I  thought  for  a  while  and  asked 
if  he  truly  felt  himself  a  brother  to  everyone — to 
all  funeral  directors,  for  example,  to  all  postmen, 
to  all  deep-sea  divers,  to  all  those  who  lived  on  the 
even-numbered  side  of  the  street,  to  all  those  who 
were  aphonic,  and  so  on.  He  answered  that  his 
book  referred  to  the  great  mass  of  the  oppressed 
and  alienated. 

"Your  mass  of  oppressed  and  alienated  is  no 
more  than  an  abstraction,"  I  said.  "Only  individ- 
uals exist — if  it  can  be  said  that  anyone  exists.  'The 
man  of  yesterday  is  not  the  man  of  today,'  some 
Greek  remarked.  We  two,  seated  on  this  bench  in 
Geneva  or  Cambridge,  are  perhaps  proof  of  this." 

Except  in  the  strict  pages  of  history,  memorable 
events  stand  in  no  need  of  memorable  phrases.  At 
the  point  of  death,  a  man  tries  to  recall  an  engrav- 
ing glimpsed  in  childhood;  about  to  enter  battle, 
soldiers  speak  of  the  mud  or  of  their  sergeant. 
Our  situation  was  unique  and,  frankly,  we  were 
unprepared  for  it.  As  fate  would  have  it,  we  talked 


16 


about  literature;  I  fear  I  said  no  more  than  the 
things  I  usually  say  to  journalists.  My  alter  ego 
believed  in  the  invention,  or  discovery,  of  new 
metaphors;  I,  in  those  metaphors  that  correspond 
to  intimate  and  obvious  affinities  and  that  our 
imagination  has  already  accepted.  Old  age  and 
sunset,  dreams  and  life,  the  flow  of  time  and 
water.  I  put  forward  this  opinion,  which  years 
later  he  would  put  forward  in  a  book.  He  barely 
listened  to  me.  Suddenly,  he  said,  "If  you  have 
been  me,  how  do  you  explain  the  fact  that  you 
have  forgotten  your  meeting  with  an  elderly  gen- 
tleman who  in  1918  told  you  that  he,  too,  was 
Borges?" 

I  had  not  considered  this  difficulty.  "Maybe  the 
event  was  so  strange  I  chose  to  forget  it,"  I  an- 
swered without  much  conviction. 

Venturing  a  question,  he  said  shyly,  "What's 
your  memory  like?" 

I  realized  that  to  a  boy  not  yet  twenty  a  man  of 
over  seventy  was  almost  in  the  grave.  "It  often 
approaches  forgetfulness,"  I  said,  "but  it  still  finds 
what  it's  asked  to  find.  I  study  Old  English,  and  I 
am  not  at  the  bottom  of  the  class." 

Our  conversation  had  already  lasted  too  long  to 
be  that  of  a  dream.  A  sudden  idea  came  to  me.  "I 
can  prove  at  once  that  you  are  not  dreaming  me," 
I  said.  "Listen  carefully  to  this  line,  which,  as  far  as 
I  know,  you've  never  read." 

Slowly  I  entoned  the  famous  verse,  "L'hydre- 
univers  tordant  son  corps  ecaille  d'astres."  I  felt  his  al- 
most fearful  awe.  He  repeated  the  line,  low- 
voiced,  savoring  each  resplendent  word. 

"It's  true,"  he  faltered.  "I'll  never  be  able  to 
write  a  line  like  that."

Victor  Hugo  had  brought  us  together. 

Before  this,  I  now  recall,  he  had  fervently  re- 
cited that  short  piece  of  Whitman's  in  which  the 
poet  remembers  a  night  shared  beside  the  sea 
when  he  was  really  happy. 

"If  Whitman  celebrated  that  night,"  I  remarked, 
"it's  because  he  desired  it  and  it  did  not  happen. 
The  poem  gains  if  we  look  on  it  as  the  expression 
of  a  longing,  not  the  account  of  an  actual  happen- 
ing." 

He  stared  at  me  open-mouthed.  "You  don't 
know  him!"  he  exclaimed.  "Whitman  is  incapable 
of  telling  a  lie." 

Half  a  century  does  not  pass  in  vain.  Beneath 
our  conversation  about  people  and  random  read- 
ing and  our  different  tastes,  I  realized  that  we 
were  unable  to  understand  each  other.  We  were 
too  similar  and  too  unalike.  We  were  unable  to 
take  each  other  in,  which  makes  conversation  dif- 
ficult. Each  of  us  was  a  caricature  copy  of  the 
other.  The  situation  was  too  abnormal  to  last 
much  longer.  Either  to  offer  advice  or  to  argue 
was  pointless,  since,  unavoidably,  it  was  his  fate  to 
become  the  person  I  am. 

All  at  once,  I  remembered  one  of  Coleridge's 
fantasies.  Somebody  dreams  that  on  a  journey 
through  paradise  he  is  given  a  flower.  On  awak- 
ing, he  finds  the  flower.  A  similar  trick  occurred  to 
me.  "Listen,"  I  said.  "Have  you  any  money?" 

"Yes,"  he  replied.  "I  have  about  twenty  francs. 
I've  invited  Simon  Jichlinski  to  dinner  at  the  Croc- 
odile tonight." 

"Tell  Simon  that  he  will  practice  medicine  in 
Carouge  and  that  he  will  do  much  good.  Now, 
give  me  one  of  your  coins." 

18 


He  drew  out  three  large  silver  pieces  and  some 
small  change.  Without  understanding,  he  offered 
me  a  five-franc  coin.  I  handed  him  one  of  those 
not  very  sensible  American  bills  that,  regardless  of 
their  value,  are  all  the  same  size.  He  examined  it 
avidly. 

"It  can't  be,"  he  said,  his  voice  raised.  "It  bears 
the  date  1964.  All  this  is  a  miracle,  and  the  mirac- 
ulous is  terrifying.  Witnesses  to  the  resurrection  of 
Lazarus  must  have  been  horrified." 

We  have  not  changed  in  the  least,  I  thought  to 
myself.  Ever  the  bookish  reference.  He  tore  up  the 
bill  and  put  his  coins  away.  I  decided  to  throw 
mine  into  the  river.  The  arc  of  the  big  silver  disk 
losing  itself  in  the  silver  river  would  have  con- 
ferred on  my  story  a  vivid  image,  but  luck  would 
not  have  it  so.  I  told  him  that  the  supernatural,  if 
it  occurs  twice,  ceases  to  be  terrifying.  I  suggested 
that  we  plan  to  see  each  other  the  next  day,  on  this 
same  bench,  which  existed  in  two  times  and  in  two 
places.  He  agreed  at  once  and,  without  looking  at 
his  watch,  said  that  he  was  late.  Both  of  us  were 
lying  and  we  each  knew  it  of  the  other.  I  told  him 
that  someone  was  coming  for  me. 

"Coming  for  you?"  he  said. 

"Yes.  When  you  get  to  my  age,  you  will  have  lost 
your  eyesight  almost  completely.  You'll  still  make 
out  the  color  yellow  and  lights  and  shadows.  Don't 
worry.  Gradual  blindness  is  not  a  tragedy.  It's  like 
a  slow  summer  dusk." 

We  said  goodbye  without  having  once  touched 
each  other.  The  next  day,  I  did  not  show  up.  Nei- 
ther would  he. 

I  have  brooded  a  great  deal  over  that  meeting, 
which  until  now  I  have  related  to  no  one.  I  believe 


!9 


I  have  discovered  the  key.  The  meeting  was  real, 
but  the  other  man  was  dreaming  when  he  con- 
versed with  me,  and  this  explains  how  he  was  able 
to  forget  me;  I  conversed  with  him  while  awake, 
and  the  memory  of  it  still  disturbs  me. 

The  other  man  dreamed  me,  but  he  did  not 
dream  me  exactly.  He  dreamed,  I  now  realize,  the 
date  on  the  dollar  bill.

Ulrike 


He  took  the  sword  Gram  and  laid  it  naked  between 
them. 

The  Saga  of  the  Volsungs,  29 


My  story  will  be  true  to  reality  or,  in  any  case,  to 
my  personal  memory  of  reality,  which  amounts  to 
the  same  thing.  The  events  took  place  only  a  short 
time  ago,  but  I  know  that  literary  habit  is  also  the 
habit  of  adding  circumstantial  details  and  of  un- 
derlining high  points.  I  want  to  give  an  account  of 
my  meeting  with  Ulrike  (I  never  knew7  her  sur- 
name and  perhaps  never  shall)  in  the  city  of  York. 
The  narrative  will  encompass  one  night  and  a 
morning. 

It  would  be  easy  to  say  that  I  saw  her  for  the 
first  time  by  the  Five  Sisters  of  York  Minster,  those 
stained-glass  windows  which,  pure  of  any  image, 
Cromwell's  iconoclasts  respected,  but  the  fact  is 
that  we  met  in  the  small  lounge  of  The  Northern 
Inn,  which  lies  outside  the  city  walls.  We  were  a 
handful,  and  Ulrike  stood  with  her  back  to  us. 
Someone  offered  her  a  drink  and  she  refused  it. 

"I  am  a  feminist,"  she  said.  "I  am  not  out  to  ape 
men.  I  dislike  their  tobacco  and  their  alcohol." 

The  remark  was  meant  to  be  witty,  and  I 
guessed  that  this  was  not  the  first  time  she  had  de- 


21 


livered  it.  I  later  found  out  that  it  was  not  typical 
of  her,  but  what  we  say  is  not  always  like  us.  She 
mentioned  that  she  had  arrived  at  the  museum  too 
late,  but  that  they  let  her  in  when  they  learned  she 
was  a  Norwegian. 

One  of  those  present  remarked,  "It's  not  the 
first  time  the  Norwegians  have  entered  York." 

"That's  right,"  she  said.  "England  was  once  ours 
and  we  lost  it — if  one  can  have  anything  or  if  any- 
thing can  be  lost." 

It  was  at  this  point  that  I  looked  at  her.  A  line  in 
Blake  speaks  of  girls  of  mild  silver  or  of  furious 
gold,  but  in  Ulrike  were  both  gold  and  mildness. 
She  was  tall  and  slender,  with  sharp  features  and 
gray  eyes.  Less  than  by  her  face,  I  was  impressed 
by  her  air  of  calm  mystery.  She  smiled  easily,  and 
the  smile  seemed  to  withdraw  her  from  the  com- 
pany. She  was  dressed  in  black,  which  is  strange 
for  northern  lands,  which  try  to  liven  the  drab  sur- 
roundings with  vivid  colors.  She  spoke  a  crisp, 
precise  English,  rolling  her  r's  slightly.  I  am  not 
much  of  an  observer;  these  things  I  discovered  bit 
by  bit. 

We  were  introduced.  I  told  her  that  I  was  a 
professor  at  the  University  of  the  Andes,  in 
Bogota.  I  explained  that  I  was  a  Colombian. 

She  asked  me  in  a  thoughtful  way,  "What  does  it 
mean  to  be  a  Colombian?" 

"I  don't  know,"  I  replied.  "It's  an  act  of  faith." 

"Like  being  Norwegian,"  she  affirmed. 

I  can  remember  no  more  of  what  was  said  that 
night.  The  next  day,  I  came  down  to  the  dining 
room  early.  Through  the  windows  I  saw  that  it 
had  snowed;  in  the  early  morning  light  the  moors 
faded  away.  We  were  the  only  ones  there.  Ulrike 


22 


invited  me  to  her  table.  She  told  me  that  she  liked 
going  out  for  solitary  walks. 

Recalling  a  joke  of  Schopenhauer's,  I  said,  "So 
do  I.  The  two  of  us  could  go  out  together." 

We  walked  away  from  the  inn  on  the  new-fallen 
snow.  There  was  not  a  soul  about.  I  suggested  that 
we  go  on  to  Thorgate,  a  few  miles  down  the  river. 
I  know  that  I  was  already  in  love  with  Ulrike;  I 
could  never  have  wanted  any  other  person  by  my 
side. 

All  at  once,  I  heard  the  distant  howling  of  a 
wolf.  I  had  never  before  heard  a  wolf  howl,  but  I 
knew  it  was  a  wolf.  Ulrike  was  impassive. 

A  while  later  she  said,  as  if  thinking  aloud,  "The 
few  poor  swords  I  saw  yesterday  in  York  Minster 
moved  me  more  than  the  great  ships  in  the  Oslo 
museum." 

Our  paths  had  crossed.  That  evening  Ulrike 
would  continue  her  journey  on  to  London;  I  to 
Edinburgh. 

"In  Oxford  Street,"  she  told  me,  "I  shall  follow 
De  Quincey's  footsteps  in  search  of  his  Ann,  lost 
amid  the  crowds  of  London." 

"De  Quincey  stopped  looking  for  her,"  I  replied. 
"All  my  life,  I  never  have." 

"Maybe  you've  found  her,"  Ulrike  said,  her 
voice  low. 

I  realized  that  an  unexpected  thing  was  not  for- 
bidden me,  and  I  kissed  her  on  the  mouth  and 
eyes.  She  drew  away  firmly  but  gently  and  then 
declared,  "I'll  be  yours  in  the  inn  at  Thorgate. 
Until  then,  I  ask  you  not  to  touch  me.  It  is  better 
that  way." 

To  a  bachelor  well  along  in  years,  the  offer  of 
love  is  a  gift  no  longer  expected.  The  miracle  has  a 


23 


right  to  impose  conditions.  I  thought  back  on  my 
youth  in  Popayan  and  on  a  girl  in  Texas,  as  fair 
and  slender  as  Ulrike,  who  once  denied  me  her 
love. 

I  did  not  make  the  mistake  of  asking  Ulrike 
whether  she  loved  me.  I  realized  that  this  was  not 
her  first  time  nor  would  it  be  her  last.  The  adven- 
ture, perhaps  my  last,  would  be  one  of  many  for 
that  splendid,  determined  follower  of  Ibsen.  Hand 
in  hand,  we  walked  on. 

"All  this  is  like  a  dream,  and  I  never  dream,"  I 
said. 

"Like  that  king  who  never  dreamed  until  a  wiz- 
ard made  him  sleep  in  a  pigsty,"  Ulrike  replied. 
Then  she  added,  "Listen.  A  bird  is  about  to  sing." 

A  moment  or  two  later  we  heard  the  song. 

"In  these  lands,"  I  said,  "it's  thought  that  a  per- 
son about  to  die  sees  into  the  future." 

"And  I  am  about  to  die,"  she  said. 

I  looked  at  her  in  astonishment.  "Let's  cut 
through  the  woods,"  I  urged.  "We'll  reach 
Thorgate  sooner." 

"The  woods  are  dangerous,"  she  said. 

We  continued  along  the  moors. 

"I  should  like  this  moment  to  last  forever,"  I 
murmured. 

"  'Forever'  is  a  word  forbidden  to  men,"  Ulrike 
said  and,  to  soften  the  force  of  this,  she  asked  me 
to  repeat  my  name,  which  she  had  not  caught. 

"Javier  Otalora,"  I  said. 

She  tried  to  pronounce  it  and  couldn't.  I  failed, 
equally,  with  the  name  Ulrike. 

"I  shall  call  you  Sigurd,"  she  said  with  a  smile. 

"If  I  am  Sigurd,"  I  replied,  "you  will  be  Bryn- 
hild." 


24 


She  had  slowed  her  step. 

"Do  you  know  the  saga?"  I  asked. 

"Of  course,"  she  said.  "The  tragic  story  spoiled 
by  the  Germans  with  their  late  Nibelungs." 

Not  wishing  to  argue  the  point,  I  answered, 
"Brynhild,  you're  walking  as  if  you  wished  a  sword 
lay  between  us  in  bed." 

Suddenly  we  stood  before  the  inn.  It  did  not 
surprise  me  that,  like  the  other  one,  it  was  called 
The  Northern  Inn. 

From  the  top  of  the  stairs,  Ulrike  called  down  to 
me,  "Did  you  hear  the  wolf?  There  are  no  longer 
any  wolves  in  England.  Hurry." 

Climbing  to  the  upper  floor,  I  noticed  that  the 
walls  were  papered  in  the  style  of  William  Morris, 
in  a  deep  red,  with  a  design  of  fruit  and  birds  in- 
tertwined. Ulrike  went  on  ahead.  The  dark  room 
was  low,  with  a  slanted  ceiling.  The  awaited  bed 
was  duplicated  in  a  dim  mirror,  and  the  polished 
mahogany  reminded  me  of  the  looking  glass  of 
Scriptures.  Ulrike  had  already  undressed.  She 
called  me  by  my  real  name — Javier.  I  felt  that  the 
snow  was  falling  faster.  Now  there  were  no  longer 
any  mirrors  or  furniture.  There  was  no  sword  be- 
tween us.  Time  passed  like  the  sands.  In  the  dark- 
ness, centuries  old,  love  flowed,  and  for  the  first 
and  last  time  I  possessed  Ulrike's  image.

The  Congress 


.   .   .   its  s'acheminerent  vers  un  chateau  immense,  au 

frontispice  duquel  on  lisait:  "Je  nappartiens  a  personne  et 

fappartiens  a  tout  le  monde.  Vous  y  etiez  avant  que  d'y  en- 

trer,    et   vous   y   serez   encore   quand   vous   en   sortirez." 

— Diderot,  Jacques  le  Fataliste  et  son  Maitre 


Buenos  Aires,  1955 

Alejandro  Ferri  is  my  name.  Martial  echoes  may 
be  heard  in  it,  but  neither  the  metals  of  glory  nor 
the  great  shadow  of  the  Macedonian — the  words 
belong  to  the  poet  of  The  Marble  Pillars,  who  hon- 
ored me  with  his  friendship — has  any  kinship  with 
the  nearly  anonymous  man  who  strings  together 
these  lines  on  the  upper  floor  of  a  hotel  on  San- 
tiago del  Estero  Street,  on  the  south  side  of  town, 
which  is  no  longer  the  old  Southside.  Any  day 
now,  I'll  turn  seventy-one  or  seventy-two;  I  am  still 
teaching  English  to  a  handful  of  students.  Out  of 
indecision  or  carelessness,  or  for  some  other  rea- 
son, I  never  married,  and  now  I  live  alone.  Loneli- 
ness does  not  worry  me;  life  is  difficult  enough, 
putting  up  with  yourself  and  with  your  own  habits. 
I  realize  I  am  getting  on  in  years.  An  unmistakable 
symptom  of  this  is  the  fact  that  novelties — maybe 
because  I  feel  they  hold  nothing  essentially  new 
and  are  really  no  more  than  timid  varia- 
tions— neither  interest  nor  distract  me.  When  I 
was  a  young  man,  I  was  fond  of  sunsets,  the  city's 
sprawling    slums,    and    of    unhappiness;    now    I 


27 


prefer  mornings  and  downtown  and  peace.  I  no 
longer  play  at  being  Hamlet.  I  have  become  a 
member  of  the  Conservative  Party  and  of  a  chess 
club,  which  I  usually  attend  as  an  onlooker — some- 
times an  absentminded  onlooker.  Anyone  who  is 
curious  may  dig  up  from  some  out-of-the-way 
nook  of  the  National  Library,  on  Mexico  Street,  a 
copy  of  my  Short  Study  of  John  Wilkins  Analytical 
Language,  a  work  that  sadly  stands  in  need  of  a 
new  edition,  if  only  to  correct  or  to  lessen  its  many 
mistakes.  The  library's  new  director,  I  am  told,  is  a 
literary  man  who  dedicates  himself  to  the  study  of 
ancient  languages  (as  if  modern  ones  were  not  suf- 
ficiently rudimentary)  and  to  the  demogogic  exal- 
tation of  an  imaginary  Buenos  Aires  of  knife  fight- 
ers. I  have  never  cared  to  meet  him.  I  came  to  this 
city  in  1899,  an<^  only  once  did  chance  bring  me 
face  to  face  with  a  knife  fighter  or  with  an  individ- 
ual who  had  a  reputation  as  such.  Further  on, 
should  the  occasion  present  itself,  I  shall  relate  the 
episode. 

I  have  already  said  that  I  live  alone.  Several  days 
ago,  a  fellow-roomer,  who  had  heard  me  speak  of 
Fermin  Eguren,  told  me  that  he  had  died  in  Punta 
del  Este. 

The  death  of  this  man,  who  was  certainly  never 
a  friend  of  mine,  has  unaccountably  saddened  me. 
I  know  that  I  am  alone;  I  know  that  in  the  whole 
world  I  am  the  only  keeper  of  that  secret  event — 
the  Congress — whose  memory  I  can  no  longer 
share.  I  am  now  the  last  member  of  that  Congress. 
It  is  undeniable  that  all  men  are  members  of  that 
Congress — that  there  is  not  a  single  being  on  earth 
who  is  not — but  I  know  I  am  a  member  in  a  very 
different  way.  I  know  that  I  am,  and  that's  what 


28 


sets  me  apart  from  my  numberless  colleagues, 
present  and  future.  It  is  undeniable  that  on  the 
seventh  of  February,  1904,  we  swore  by  what  is 
most  holy  (is  there  anything  holy  on  earth,  or  any- 
thing that  is  not?)  never  to  reveal  the  history  of  the 
Congress,  but  it  is  no  less  undeniable  that  my  now 
committing  perjury  is  also  part  of  the  Congress. 
This  last  statement  is  sufficiently  dim,  but  it  may 
whet  the  curiosity  of  my  eventual  readers. 

At  any  rate,  the  task  I  have  taken  upon  myself  is 
not  an  easy  one.  I  have  never  before  attempted 
the  art  of  narration — not  even  in  its  epistolary 
form — and,  what  is  doubtless  even  more  impor- 
tant, the  story  itself  is  unbelievable.  The  pen  of 
Jose  Fernandez  Irala,  the  undeservedly  forgotten 
author  of  The  Marble  Pillars,  was  the  one  destined 
for  this  work,  but  now  it  is  too  late.  I  shall  not  de- 
liberately falsify  the  real  facts,  although  I  foresee 
that  laziness  and  incompetence  will  more  than 
once  lead  me  into  error. 

Exact  dates  are  of  no  account.  Let  it  be  recalled 
that  I  came  from  Santa  Fe,  my  native  province,  in 
1899.  I  have  never  gone  back.  I  have  grown  accus- 
tomed to  Buenos  Aires,  a  city  I  am  not  fond  of,  in 
the  same  way  that  a  man  grows  accustomed  to  his 
own  body  or  to  an  old  ailment.  Without  much  car- 
ing, I  am  aware  that  I  am  going  to  die  soon;  I 
must,  consequently,  control  my  digressive  tenden- 
cies and  get  on  with  my  story. 

The  years  do  not  change  our  essential  selves — if 
one  has  an  essential  self.  The  impulse  that  would 
one  night  lead  me  to  the  Congress  of  the  World 
was  the  same  that  first  brought  me  to  the  staff  of 
Ultima  Hora.  To  a  poor  boy  from  the  provinces, 


29 


becoming  a  newspaperman  was  a  romantic  fate, 
just  as  to  a  poor  city  boy  the  life  of  a  gaucho  or  a 
farmhand  is  romantic.  I  feel  no  shame  at  having 
once  wanted  to  be  a  journalist,  an  occupation  that 
now  seems  trivial  to  me.  I  remember  having  heard 
my  colleague  Fernandez  Irala  say  that  newspaper- 
men wrote  for  oblivion  but  that  his  ambition  was 
to  write  for  time  and  for  memory.  He  had  already 
chiseled  (the  verb  was  then  in  common  use)  some 
of  those  perfect  sonnets  that  were  later  to  reap- 
pear, with  one  or  two  minor  touches,  in  the  pages 
of  The  Marble  Pillars. 

I  cannot  quite  recall  the  first  time  I  heard  the 
Congress  spoken  of.  Maybe  it  was  on  that  same 
evening  the  cashier  paid  me  my  first  month's  sal- 
ary and,  to  celebrate  this  proof  that  Buenos  Aires 
had  taken  me  to  its  bosom,  I  suggested  to  Irala 
that  we  dine  together.  He  excused  himself,  saying 
he  could  not  miss  the  Congress.  I  understood  at 
once  that  he  was  not  referring  to  the  rather  pomp- 
ous, domed  building  at  the  foot  of  an  avenue  peo- 
pled by  Spaniards  but  to  something  more  secret 
and  far  more  important.  People  spoke  of  the  Con- 
gress, some  with  open  scorn,  others  with  lowered 
voices,  still  others  with  alarm  or  curiosity — all,  I 
believe,  without  knowing  anything  about  it.  A  few 
Saturdays  later,  Irala  invited  me  to  go  along  with 
him. 

It  must  have  been  nine  or  ten  o'clock  at  night. 
On  our  way,  in  a  streetcar,  he  told  me  these  pre- 
liminary meetings  took  place  every  Saturday  and 
that  don  Alejandro  Glencoe,  the  president  of  the 
Congress,  perhaps  struck  by  my  name,  had  al- 
ready signed  his  approval  of  my  attendance.  We 
went  to  the  Gas-Lamp  Coffee  House.  Some  fifteen 


3° 


or  twenty  members  of  the  Congress  sat  around  a 
long  table;  I  don't  know  if  there  was  a  dais  or  if 
memory  adds  it.  I  immediately  recognized  the 
president,  whom  I  had  never  seen  before.  Don 
Alejandro  was  a  gentleman,  already  well  along  in 
years,  with  a  high  forehead  and  thinning  hair, 
gray  eyes,  and  a  graying  reddish  beard.  I  always 
saw  him  dressed  in  a  dark  frock  coat,  and  he 
usually  held  his  hands  locked  together  over  the 
head  of  his  cane.  He  was  portly  and  tall.  To  his 
left  sat  a  much  younger  man,  also  with  red  hair. 
Its  violent  color  suggested  fire,  while  the  color  of 
Mr.  Glencoe's  beard  suggested  autumn  leaves.  To 
his  right  was  a  long-faced  young  man  with  an  unu- 
sually low  forehead  and  dressed  like  a  dandy.  Ev- 
eryone had  ordered  coffee,  and  several  absinthe. 
What  first  caught  my  attention  was  the  presence  of 
a  woman — the  only  woman  among  so  many  men. 
At  the  other  end  of  the  table  sat  a  boy  of  about 
ten,  dressed  in  a  sailor  suit,  who  was  not  long  in 
falling  asleep.  There  were  also  a  Protestant  minis- 
ter, two  unmistakable  Jews,  and  a  Negro,  who, 
with  a  white  silk  handkerchief  around  his  neck 
and  very  tight-fitting  clothes,  was  dressed  like  a 
street-corner  hoodlum.  In  front  of  the  Negro  and 
the  boy  were  cups  of  chocolate.  I  do  not  re- 
member any  of  the  other  people  except  for  a  Mr. 
Marcelo  del  Mazo,  a  man  of  great  politeness  and 
fine  conversation,  whom  I  never  saw  again.  (I  still 
have  a  faded,  poorly  done  photograph  of  one  of 
the  gatherings,  but  I  shall  not  publish  it,  since  the 
dress,  the  long  hair,  and  the  mustaches  of  that 
period  would  make  the  whole  thing  look  bur- 
lesque and  even  shabby.) 

All  groups  tend  to  create  their  own  dialects  and 


31 


rites;  the  Congress,  which  always  had  something 
dreamlike  about  it,  seemed  to  want  its  members  to 
discover — at  leisure  and  for  themselves — its  real 
aim  and  even  the  names  and  surnames  of  its  mem- 
bers. I  was  not  long  in  realizing  that  I  was  duty- 
bound  not  to  ask  questions,  and  I  refrained  even 
from  asking  any  of  Fernandez  Irala,  who  never 
told  me  a  thing.  I  did  not  miss  a  single  Saturday, 
but  a  good  month  or  two  went  by  before  I  reached 
this  understanding.  From  the  second  meeting  on, 
my  neighbor  was  Donald  Wren,  an  engineer  on  the 
Southern  Railways,  who  was  to  give  me  English 
lessons. 

Don  Alejandro  spoke  very  little.  The  rest  did 
not  address  themselves  directly  to  him,  but  I  felt 
that  their  words  were  meant  for  him  and  that  ev- 
eryone was  after  his  approval.  One  gesture  of  his 
slow  hand  was  enough  to  change  the  topic  of  dis- 
cussion. I  came  to  find  out,  little  by  little,  that  the 
red-haired  man  to  his  left  bore  the  strange  name 
of  Twirl.  I  remember  that  fragile  look  of  his, 
which,  as  though  their  stature  made  them  dizzy 
and  forced  them  to  hunch  forward,  is  character- 
istic of  some  very  tall  people.  His  hand,  I  recall, 
often  played  with  a  copper  compass  case,  which 
from  time  to  time  he  set  on  the  table.  At  the  end 
of  1914,  he  was  killed  as  an  infantryman  in  an 
Irish  regiment.  The  person  who  always  sat  to  the 
right,  the  young  man  with  the  low  forehead,  was 
Fermin  Eguren,  the  president's  nephew. 

Putting  no  faith  in  the  methods  of  realism  (a 
most  artificial  school  if  there  ever  was  one),  I  shall 
declare  right  off  what  I  learned  only  little  by  little. 
Beforehand,  I  want  to  remind  the  reader  of  my 
situation  at  the  time.  I  was  a  poor  boy  from  Ca- 


32 


silda,  a  farmer's  son,  who  had  come  to  the  capital 
and  suddenly  found  himself — this  was  the  way  I 
felt — in  the  intimate  heart  of  Buenos  Aires  and 
perhaps  (who  knows?)  of  the  whole  world.  After 
half  a  century,  I  still  feel  those  first  dazzling  mo- 
ments, which  certainly  were  not  to  be  the  last. 

Here  are  the  facts.  I  shall  tell  them  as  briefly  as  I 
can.  Don  Alejandro  Glencoe,  the  president,  was  an 
Uruguayan  rancher  and  owner  of  a  large  spread 
of  land  bordering  on  Brazil.  His  father,  a  native  of 
Aberdeen,  had  established  himself  on  this  conti- 
nent around  the  middle  of  the  last  century.  He 
brought  with  him  some  hundred  books — the  only 
books,  I  venture  to  say,  that  don  Alejandro  read  in 
the  course  of  his  life.  (I  speak  of  these  assorted 
books,  which  I  have  had  in  my  hands,  because  in 
one  of  them  lies  the  root  of  my  story.)  The  elder 
Mr.  Glencoe,  on  dying,  left  a  daughter  and  a  son. 
The  son  was  later  to  become  our  president;  the 
daughter  married  an  Eguren  and  was  Fermin's 
mother.  Don  Alejandro  at  one  time  aspired  to  the 
Uruguayan  National  Congress,  but  the  political 
bosses  barred  his  way.  Rankled,  he  decided  to 
found  another  Congress  and  on  a  vaster  scale.  He 
remembered  having  read  in  the  volcanic  pages  of 
Carlyle  the  fate  of  Anacharsis  Clootz,  that 
worshiper  of  the  goddess  Reason  who,  at  the  head 
of  thirty-six  foreigners,  addressed  a  Paris  assembly 
as  "mankind's  spokesman."  Moved  by  this  ex- 
ample, don  Alejandro  conceived  the  idea  of  calling 
together  a  Congress  of  the  World  that  would  rep- 
resent all  men  of  all  nations.  The  center  for  the 
preliminary  meetings  was  the  Gas-Lamp  Coffee 
House;  the  formal  act  of  inauguration,  which 
would  take  place  within  some  four  years,  would  be 


33 


held  at  don  Alejandro's  ranch.  Like  so  many 
Uruguayans,  don  Alejandro — who  was  no  lover  of 
Uruguay's  now  national  hero,  Artigas — was  fond 
of  Buenos  Aires,  but  he  nonetheless  decided  that 
the  Congress  must  eventually  meet  in  his  own 
country.  Oddly  enough,  the  four-year  planning 
period  was  carried  out  with  a  precision  that  was  al- 
most magical. 

In  the  beginning,  we  were  paid  a  considerable 
sum  as  a  per  diem,  but  the  zeal  that  enflamed  us 
prompted  Fernandez  Irala — who  was  as  poor  as  I 
was — to  renounce  his,  and  all  the  rest  of  us  fol- 
lowed suit.  This  measure  was  healthy,  since  it 
served  to  separate  the  wheat  from  the  chaff;  the 
number  of  members  was  reduced,  and  only  the 
faithful  remained.  The  one  paid  position  was  that 
of  the  secretary,  Nora  Erfjord,  who  lacked  other 
means  of  support  and  whose  work  at  the  same 
time  was  staggering.  To  set  up  a  worldwide  orga- 
nization is  no  trifling  enterprise.  Letters  came  and 
went,  and  so  did  cables  and  telegrams.  Potential 
delegates  wrote  from  Peru,  Denmark,  and  India. 
A  Bolivian  wrote  that  his  country's  lack  of  access  to 
the  sea  should  be  a  matter  of  prime  consideration 
in  our  first  meetings.  Twirl,  who  had  a  farseeing 
mind,  remarked  that  the  Congress  involved  a 
problem  of  a  philosophical  nature.  Planning  an  as- 
sembly to  represent  all  men  was  like  fixing  the 
exact  number  of  platonic  types — a  puzzle  that  had 
taxed  the  imagination  of  thinkers  for  centuries. 
Twirl  suggested  that,  without  going  farther  afield, 
don  Alejandro  Glencoe  might  represent  not  only 
cattlemen  but  also  Uruguayans,  and  also  human- 
ity's great   forerunners,   and   also  men  with   red 


34 


beards,  and  also  those  who  are  seated  in  arm- 
chairs. Nora  Erfjord  was  Norwegian.  Would  she 
represent  secretaries,  Norwegian  womanhood, 
or — more  obviously — all  beautiful  women?  Would 
a  single  engineer  be  enough  to  represent  all 
engineers — including  those  of  New  Zealand? 

It  was  then,  I  believe,  that  Fermin  broke  in. 
"Ferri  represents  the  gringos,"  he  said  in  a  flood 
of  laughter. 

Don  Alejandro  looked  at  him  severely  and,  in  an 
even  voice,  said,  "Mr.  Ferri  is  representative  of  the 
immigrants  whose  labor  is  building  up  this  coun- 
try." " 

Fermin  Eguren  never  could  bear  the  sight  of 
me.  He  took  pride  in  an  assortment  of  things:  in 
being  Uruguayan;  in  coming  from  old  stock;  in  at- 
tracting women;  in  having  chosen  an  expensive 
tailor;  and,  God  knows  why,  in  his  Basque  origin — 
a  people  who  throughout  history  have  done  little 
else  than  milk  cows. 

An  incident  of  the  most  trivial  sort  sealed  our 
enmity.  After  one  of  the  meetings,  Eguren  sug- 
gested that  we  pay  a  visit  to  one  of  the  Junin  Street 
brothels.  The  plan  did  not  attract  me,  but,  in 
order  not  to  make  myself  the  butt  of  his  jokes,  I 
accepted.  We  went  with  Fernandez  Irala.  On  leav- 
ing the  establishment,  we  ran  into  a  huge  specimen 
of  a  man.  Eguren,  who  may  have  been  a  bit  drunk, 
gave  him  a  shove.  The  stranger  quickly  barred  our 
way  and  told  us,  "Whoever  wants  to  leave  is  going 
to  have  to  pass  by  this  knife." 

I  remember  the  glint  of  the  blade  in  the  dark- 
ness of  the  long  entranceway.  Eguren  drew  back, 
visibly  afraid.  I  wasn't  too  sure  of  myself,  but  my 
hatred  got  the  best  of  my  fright.  I  reached  into  my 


35 


armpit,  as  if  to  draw  out  a  weapon,  and  said  in  a 
firm  voice,  "We'll  settle  this  out  on  the  street." 

The  stranger  answered — with  another  voice 
now,  "That's  the  kind  of  man  I  like.  I  wanted  to 
test  you,  friend."  Then  he  began  to  laugh  in  a  cor- 
dial way. 

"As  to  'friend,'  "  I  answered  him,  "that's  what 
you  think."  The  three  of  us  made  our  way  past 
him. 

The  man  with  the  knife  entered  the  brothel.  I 
heard  later  that  his  name  was  Tapia,  or  Paredes, 
or  something  of  the  kind,  and  that  he  had  a  repu- 
tation for  brawling.  Out  on  the  sidewalk,  Irala, 
who  had  kept  cool,  slapped  me  on  the  back  and 
said,  impressively,  "Among  us  three,  we  had  a 
musketeer.  Hail,  d'Artagnan!" 

Fermin  Eguren  never  forgave  me  for  having 
witnessed  his  backing  down. 

I  feel  that  now,  and  only  now,  my  story  begins. 
The  preceding  pages  have  set  down  no  more  than 
the  conditions  that  chance  or  fate  required  so  that 
the  unbelievable  event — perhaps  the  single  event 
of  my  whole  life — might  take  place.  Don  Alejan- 
dro Glencoe  was  always  at  the  center  of  the  Con- 
gress, but  over  a  period  of  time  we  felt,  not  with- 
out misgiving,  that  the  real  president  was  Twirl. 
This  singular  character,  with  the  flaming  mus- 
tache, fawned  on  Glencoe  and  even  on  Fermin 
Eguren — but  in  such  an  exaggerated  way  that 
those  present  would  think  he  was  actually  mocking 
the  two.  By  so  doing,  he  never  once  compromised 
his  integrity.  Glencoe  labored  under  the  pride  of 
his  vast  fortune;  Twirl  discovered  that  in  order  to 
get  anything  done  it  was  enough  to  suggest  that  its 

36 


cost  might  prove  beyond  the  president's  means.  It 
is  my  suspicion  that  at  the  outset  the  Congress  had 
been  nothing  more  than  a  haphazard  sort  of 
name.  Twirl  was  continually  proposing  new  areas 
of  expansion,  and  don  Alejandro  always  accepted. 
It  was  like  being  at  the  middle  of  a  spreading  cir- 
cle, which  grows  ever  larger  and  always  farther 
away.  Twirl  said,  for  example,  that  the  Congress 
could  not  get  along  without  a  reference  library, 
and  Nierenstein,  who  worked  in  a  bookshop,  went 
about  ordering  us  the  atlases  of  Justus  Perthes  and 
several  extensive  encyclopedias — all  the  way  from 
Pliny's  Natural  History  and  Beauvais'  Speculum 
down  to  the  pleasant  mazes  (I  reread  these  words 
with  Fernandez  Irala's  voice)  of  the  illustrious 
French  Encyclopedists,  of  the  Bi  itannica,  of  Pierre 
Larousse,  of  Brockhaus,  of  Larsen,  and  of  Mon- 
taner  y  Simon.  I  recall  how  I  reverently  fondled 
the  silky  volumes  of  a  certain  Chinese  en- 
cyclopedia whose  finely  brushed  characters 
seemed  to  me  more  mysterious  than  the  spots  on  a 
leopard's  skin.  As  yet,  I  will  say  nothing  of  what 
lay  in  store  for  them  and  which  certainly  I  do  not 
regret. 

Don  Alejandro,  maybe  because  we  were  the  only 
ones  who  did  not  try  to  flatter  him,  had  grown 
quite  fond  of  Fernandez  Irala  and  me.  He  invited 
us  to  spend  a  few  days  at  his  ranch,  La  Caledonia, 
where  he  had  a  crew  of  stonemasons  already  at 
work. 

At  the  end  of  a  long  trip  upriver  by  steamer  and 
a  ferry  crossing  on  a  raft,  we  set  foot  one  morning 
on  the  Uruguay  shore.  We  then  had  to  spend  suc- 
cessive nights  in  run-down  country  saloons,  while 


37 


opening  and  shutting  dozens  of  gateways  all  day 
along  back  roads  in  the  Cuchilla  Negra.  We  made 
our  way  in  a  light  carriage;  the  countryside 
seemed  wider  and  lonelier  to  me  than  the  small 
farm  where  I  was  born. 

I  still  hold  my  two  images  of  the  ranch — the  one 
I  brought  with  me  and  the  one  my  eyes  finally  saw. 
Absurdly,  I  had  imagined,  as  in  a  dream,  an  im- 
possible combination  of  the  flat  plains  of  Santa  Fe 
and  of  the  rather  gaudy  Victorian  Buenos  Aires 
Waterworks.  La  Caledonia  was  a  long  adobe  build- 
ing with  a  thatched  saddle  roof  and  a  brick-paved 
gallery.  It  appeared  to  be  built  for  hardship  and 
endurance.  The  rough  walls  were  nearly  a  yard 
thick  and  the  doors  were  narrow.  Nobody  had 
ever  thought  of  planting  a  tree.  The  sun's  first  and 
last  rays  beat  down  on  the  place.  The  corrals  were 
of  stone;  the  cattle  were  many,  scrawny  and  long- 
horned;  the  horses'  switching  tails  reached  the 
ground.  For  the  first  time  in  my  life,  I  knew  the 
taste  of  freshly  slaughtered  meat.  Some  sacks  of 
sea  biscuit  were  brought  out;  a  few  days  later,  the 
foreman  told  me  he  had  never  eaten  bread  in  his 
life.  Irala  asked  where  the  bathroom  was,  and, 
with  a  sweeping  gesture,  don  Alejandro  indicated 
the  entire  continent.  It  was  a  moonlit  night;  I  went 
out  to  stretch  my  legs,  and  I  surprised  Irala  being 
watched  by  an  ostrich. 

The  heat,  which  the  night  had  not  dispelled,  was 
unbearable,  and  everyone  praised  the  coolness. 
The  rooms  were  low-ceilinged  and  many,  and 
seemed  to  me  barely  furnished;  we  were  given  one, 
facing  south,  in  which  there  were  two  cots  and  a 
dresser  with  a  silver  washbasin  and  pitcher.  The 
floor  was  dirt. 


38 


The  second  day,  I  came  across  the  library  and 
the  volumes  of  Carlyle,  and  I  found  the  pages 
dedicated  to  mankind's  spokesman,  Anacharsis 
Clootz,  who  had  led  me  to  that  morning  and  to 
that  loneliness.  After  breakfast,  which  was  iden- 
tical with  dinner,  don  Alejandro  showed  us  the 
building  under  construction.  We  rode  three  or 
four  miles  on  horseback  out  in  the  wide  open. 
Irala,  whose  horsemanship  was  shaky,  had  an  ac- 
cident; unsmiling,  the  foreman  remarked,  "You 
Argentines  really  know  how  to  dismount." 

From  way  off,  we  could  see  the  construction  site. 
Some  twenty  men  were  at  work  building  a  kind  of 
tumbledown  amphitheater.  I  recall  a  series  of 
stages  and  ladders  and  stone  tiers  with  stretches  of 
sky  showing  between. 

More  than  once,  I  tried  to  speak  with  the  gau- 
chos,  but  my  efforts  failed.  In  some  way,  they 
knew  they  were  different.  Among  themselves,  they 
used  a  spare,  guttural  Brazilianized  Spanish.  It 
was  obvious  that  both  Indian  and  Negro  blood  ran 
in  their  veins.  They  were  short  and  strong;  at  La 
Caledonia,  I  became  a  tall  man — something  that 
had  never  happened  to  me  until  then. 

Almost  all  of  them  dressed  with  their  legs 
wrapped  in  the  chiripd,  and  a  few  wore  the  wide, 
baggy  bombachas.  They  had  little  or  nothing  in 
common  with  the  complaining  heroes  found  in  the 
books  of  Hernandez  or  of  Rafael  Obligado.  Under 
the  stimulus  of  Saturday-night  alcohol,  they  were 
easily  moved  to  violence.  There  wasn't  a  single 
woman  around,  and  I  never  once  heard  a  guitar. 

I  was  more  interested  in  the  change  that  had 
come  over  don  Alejandro  than  I  was  in  these 
border-country  men.  In  Buenos  Aires,  he  was  a 


39 


pleasant,  reserved  gentleman;  at  La  Caledonia, 
like  his  fathers  before  him,  he  became  the  stern 
chief  of  a  clan.  Sunday  mornings,  he  read  Holy 
Scripture  to  the  hands,  who  did  not  understand  a 
single  word.  One  night,  the  foreman,  a  youngish 
man  who  had  inherited  the  job  from  his  father,  re- 
ported to  us  that  one  of  the  day  laborers  and  one 
of  the  regular  help  were  having  it  out  with  knives. 
Don  Alejandro  got  up,  unruffled.  When  he  came 
to  the  circle  of  onlookers,  he  drew  out  the  weapon 
he  always  carried,  handed  it  to  the  foreman  (who 
appeared  to  me  to  cringe),  and  stepped  between 
the  knives.  At  once,  I  heard  the  order,  "Drop 
those  knives,  boys."  With  the  same  calm  voice,  he 
added,  "Now  shake  hands  and  behave  yourselves. 
I  don't  want  any  brawling  around  here." 

The  two  men  obeyed.  The  next  day,  I  learned 
that  don  Alejandro  had  fired  the  foreman. 

I  felt  the  loneliness  ringing  me  in,  and  I  began 
fearing  I'd  never  get  back  to  Buenos  Aires.  I 
wonder  whether  Fernandez  Irala  shared  that  fear. 
We  talked  a  lot  about  Argentina  and  what  we'd  do 
when  we  returned.  I  missed  the  stone  lions  of  a 
certain  gateway  on  Jujuy  Street,  near  the  Plaza  del 
Once,  and  the  light  of  a  particular  old  bar  in  some 
dim  part  of  town,  but  not  my  familiar  haunts. 
Always  a  good  rider,  I  fell  into  the  habit  of  going 
out  on  horseback  and  riding  long  distances.  I  still 
remember  the  particular  piebald  I  used  to  saddle 
up  myself.  On  some  afternoon  or  on  some  night 
or  other,  I  probably  was  in  Brazil,  since  the  border 
was  nothing  but  a  line  traced  out  by  widely  spaced 
markers.  Then,  at  the  close  of  a  day  exactly  like  all 
the  rest,  don  Alejandro  told  us,  "We'll  turn  in 
early.  Tomorrow  we'll  be  off  while  it's  still  cool." 


40 


Once  down  the  river,  I  felt  so  happy  that  I  was 
even  able  to  think  back  to  La  Caledonia  with  affec- 
tion. 

We  took  up  our  Saturday  meetings  again.  At  the 
first  one,  Twirl  asked  for  the  floor.  He  said,  with 
his  usual  flowers  of  rhetoric,  that  the  library  of  the 
Congress  of  the  World  could  not  be  limited  to  ref- 
erence books  alone,  and  that  the  classical  works  of 
all  nations  and  all  languages  were  a  veritable  store- 
house that  we  could  not  safely  afford  to  ignore. 
The  suggestion  was  approved  on  the  spot;  Fer- 
nandez Irala  and  Dr.  Ignacio  Cruz,  who  was  a 
teacher  of  Latin,  accepted  the  job  of  selecting  the 
appropriate  texts.  Twirl  had  already  talked  things 
over  with  Nierenstein. 

In  those  days,  there  wasn't  a  single  Argentine 
whose  Utopia  was  not  Paris.  Perhaps  the  most  en- 
thusiastic of  us  was  Fermin  Eguren;  next,  for  quite 
different  reasons,  came  Fernandez  Irala.  To  the 
poet  of  The  Marble  Pillars,  Paris  was  Verlaine  and 
Leconte  de  Lisle,  while  to  Eguren  it  was  an  im- 
proved version  of  Junin  Street.  I  suspect  that  he 
had  come  to  some  understanding  with  Twirl.  At  a 
subsequent  meeting,  Twirl  brought  up  the  ques- 
tion of  what  language  the  members  of  the 
Congress  would  use,  arguing  the  feasibility  of 
sending  delegates  to  London  and  Paris  to  gather 
information.  Feigning  impartiality,  he  first  put  up 
my  name,  and  then,  as  an  apparent  afterthought, 
that  of  his  friend  Eguren.  As  always,  don  Alejan- 
dro agreed. 

I  think  I  have  written  that,  in  exchange  for 
some  lessons  in  Italian,  Wren  had  initiated  me  into 
the  study  of  the  inexhaustible  English  language. 


41 


As  far  as  possible,  we  did  away  with  grammar  and 
with  those  exercises  concocted  for  the  beginner, 
and  we  found  our  way  directly  into  poetry,  whose 
forms  demand  brevity.  My  first  contact  with  the 
language  that  was  to  fill  out  my  life  was  Steven- 
son's brave  "Requiem."  Then  came  the  ballads  that 
Percy  revealed  to  the  dignified  eighteenth  century. 
A  short  while  before  leaving  for  London,  I  was 
dazzled  by  Swinburne — an  experience  that  made 
me  begin  to  doubt  (and  to  feel  guilty  about  it)  the 
eminence  of  Irala's  alexandrines. 

I  reached  London  early  in  January,  1902;  I  re- 
member the  soft  touch  of  falling  snow,  which  I 
had  never  before  seen  and  for  which  I  was  grate- 
ful. Luckily,  Eguren  and  I  had  traveled  separately. 
I  roomed  at  a  modest  boarding  house  behind  the 
British  Museum,  where  mornings  and  afternoons 
I  studied  in  the  library  in  search  of  a  language 
worthy  of  the  Congress  of  the  World.  I  did  not 
overlook  universal  languages,  investigating  both 
Esperanto — which  Lugones  qualifies  as  "impartial, 
simple,  and  economical" — and  Volaptik,  which, 
declining  verbs  and  conjugating  nouns,  attempts 
to  work  out  all  linguistic  possibilities.  I  also 
weighed  the  arguments  in  favor  of  and  against  the 
revival  of  Latin,  a  nostalgia  for  which  has  endured 
down  through  the  centuries.  I  even  dwelled  on  an 
examination  of  John  Wilkins'  analytical  language, 
in  which  the  definition  of  each  word  is  to  be  found 
in  the  letters  that  spell  it  out.  It  was  beneath  the 
high  dome  of  the  reading  room  that  I  first  met 
Beatrice. 

This  is  meant  to  be  a  general  history  of  the 
Congress  of  the  World,  not  of  Alejandro  Ferri,  but 


42 


the  former  takes  in  the  latter,  just  as  it  takes  in  all 
other  histories.  Beatrice  was  tall,  trim,  with  fine 
features  and  a  head  of  red  hair  that  might  have 
reminded  me — but  never  did — of  the  shady  Twirl. 
She  was  not  yet  twenty.  She  had  come  down  from 
one  of  the  northern  counties  to  study  literature  at 
the  university.  Her  background,  like  mine,  was 
humble.  At  that  time,  to  be  of  Italian  stock  in 
Buenos  Aires  was  still  to  be  looked  down  on,  but 
in  London  I  found  out  that  being  Italian  was  to 
many  people  a  romantic  attribute.  Within  a  few 
evenings,  we  were  lovers;  I  asked  her  to  marry  me, 
but  Beatrice  Frost,  like  Nora  Erfjord,  was  a  fol- 
lower of  the  faith  preached  by  Ibsen,  and  she  did 
not  want  to  tie  herself  down  to  anyone.  From  her 
lips  came  the  word  I  never  dared  speak.  O  nights, 
O  darkness  warm  and  shared,  O  love  that  flows  in 
shadows  like  some  secret  river,  O  that  instant  of 
ecstasy  when  each  is  both,  O  that  ecstasy's  purity 
and  innocence,  O  the  coupling  in  which  we  be- 
came lost  so  as  then  to  lose  ourselves  in  sleep,  O 
the  first  light  of  dawn,  and  I  watching  her. 

On  the  rough  Brazil  border,  I  had  been  plagued 
by  homesickness;  not  so  in  London's  red  labyrinth, 
which  gave  me  so  many  things.  Despite  the  pre- 
texts I  dreamed  up  to  delay  my  departure,  I  had 
to  return  home  at  the  end  of  the  year.  Beatrice 
and  I  celebrated  Christmas  together.  I  assured  her 
that  don  Alejandro  would  invite  her  to  join  the 
Congress;  she  answered,  in  an  offhand  way,  that 
she  had  always  wanted  to  visit  the  Southern  Hemi- 
sphere, and  that  a  cousin  of  hers,  a  dentist,  had 
settled  in  Tasmania. 

Beatrice  did  not  want  to  come  to  the  boat. 
Goodbyes,  to  her  way  of  thinking,  were  too  dra- 


43 


matic,  were  a  senseless  feast  of  unhappiness,  and 
she  detested  dramatics.  We  parted  in  the  library, 
where  we  had  met  the  winter  before.  As  a  man, 
I'm  a  coward;  to  avoid  the  anguish  of  waiting  for 
letters,  I  did  not  leave  her  my  address. 

Return  trips  are  shorter,  I  have  always  noticed, 
but  that  crossing  of  the  Atlantic,  heavy  with  mem- 
ories and  anxieties,  seemed  unusually  long.  Noth- 
ing hurt  me  as  much  as  thinking  that,  in  a  parallel 
with  my  life,  Beatrice  would  go  on  living  hers, 
minute  by  minute  and  night  by  night.  I  wrote  a 
lengthy  letter,  destroying  it  as  we  left  Montevideo. 
When  I  reached  Argentina — it  was  on  a 
Thursday — Irala  was  waiting  for  me  at  the  dock.  I 
went  back  to  my  old  place  on  Chile  Street;  that  day 
and  the  next  he  and  I  spent  together  talking  and 
taking  long  walks.  I  wanted  to  recover  Buenos 
Aires  again.  It  was  a  relief  to  find  out  that  Fermin 
Eguren  was  staying  on  in  Paris;  I  knew  the  fact  of 
my  having  come  back  before  him  would  in  some 
way  make  up  for  my  long  absence. 

Irala  was  downcast.  Fermin  was  squandering 
huge  sums  in  Europe  and  had  more  than  once  dis- 
obeyed the  order  to  return  home.  This  was  to 
have  been  foreseen.  I  was  more  disturbed  by  other 
news.  Twirl,  in  spite  of  the  opposition  of  Irala  and 
Cruz,  had  invoked  the  Younger  Pliny,  according 
to  whom  there  is  no  book  so  bad  it  does  not  con- 
tain some  good,  and  had  proposed  the  indiscrim- 
inate purchase  of  bound  volumes  of  the  daily 
press,  of  thirty-four  hundred  copies  of  Don  Quixote 
in  various  editions,  of  the  complete  works  of  Gen- 
eral Mitre,  of  Ph.D.  theses,  of  old  account  books, 
of  bulletins,  and  of  theater  programs.  Everything 


44 


gives  witness,  he  had  said.  Nierenstein  backed 
him;  don  Alejandro,  "after  three  resounding  Sat- 
urdays" (as  Irala  put  it),  approved  the  motion. 
Nora  Erfjord  had  resigned  her  position  as  secre- 
tary; it  was  taken  over  by  a  new  member,  Kar- 
linski,  who  was  a  tool  of  Twirl's.  The  bulky  pack- 
ages began  piling  up  now,  without  files  or  catalogs, 
in  the  back  rooms  and  in  the  wine  cellar  of  don 
Alejandro's  rambling  old  town  house.  Early  in 
Juh,  Irala  spent  a  week  back  at  La  Caledonia, 
where  the  masons  had  broken  off  their  work.  The 
foreman,  upon  questioning,  explained  that  that 
was  what  the  boss  had  ordered,  and  that  there 
would  always  be  time  enough  tomorrow. 

In  London,  I  had  drafted  a  report  that  there  is 
now  no  point  in  going  into.  That  Friday,  I  went  to 
pay  a  visit  to  don  Alejandro  and  to  deliver  a  copy 
of  what  I  had  written.  Fernandez  Irala  came  with 
me.  It  was  early  evening,  and  the  cold  south  wind 
blew  into  the  house.  At  the  front  gate,  on  Alsina 
Street,  a  delivery  wagon,  pulled  by  three  horses, 
stood  waiting.  I  remember  that  the  deliverymen 
were  weighed  down  under  the  loads  they  went 
about  piling  up  in  the  last  patio.  Twirl  was  imperi- 
ous, giving  them  orders.  Also  present,  indoors,  as 
if  they  had  had  an  inkling  of  something,  were 
Nora  Erfjord  and  Nierenstein  and  Cruz  and  Don- 
ald Wren  and  a  few  other  members  of  the  Con- 
gress. Nora  threw  her  arms  around  me  and  kissed 
me,  and  that  embrace  and  that  kiss  made  me  re- 
member others.  The  Negro,  brimming  over  with 
good  nature  and  happiness,  kissed  my  hand. 

In  one  of  the  rooms,  the  square  trapdoor  to  the 
cellar  was  wide  open;  some  masonry  steps  plunged 
down  into  darkness.  Suddenly  we  heard  footsteps. 


45 


Before  laying  eyes  on  him,  I  knew  it  was  don  Ale- 
jandro. He  came  almost  on  the  run. 

His  voice  was  different.  It  was  not  the  voice  of 
the  deliberate  gentleman  who  presided  over  our 
Saturdays,  nor  that  of  the  feudal  landowner  who 
had  put  a  stop  to  a  knife  duel  and  who  preached 
the  word  of  God  to  his  gauchos — but  it  seemed 
more  like  this  latter. 

Without  looking  at  anyone,  he  ordered,  "Get  ev- 
erything out  that's  packed  away  down  there.  I 
don't  want  a  single  book  left  in  that  cellar." 

The  work  went  on  for  nearly  an  hour.  Outside, 
on  the  earth  floor  of  the  last  patio,  we  made  a  pile 
that  was  taller  than  the  tallest  head.  All  of  us 
marched  back  and  forth;  the  only  person  who 
failed  to  move  was  don  Alejandro. 

Then  came  the  order,  "Now  set  fire  to  that 
heap." 

Twirl  went  pale.  Nierenstein  blurted,  "How  can 
the  Congress  of  the  World  do  without  this  valuable 
material  I've  collected  with  so  much  love?" 

"The  Congress  of  the  World?"  said  don  Alejan- 
dro. He  laughed  scornfully.  I  had  never  before 
heard  him  laugh. 

There  is  a  mysterious  pleasure  in  destruction. 
The  flames  crackled  brightly,  and  we  all  had  to 
press  back  against  the  walls  or  move  indoors. 
Darkness,  ashes,  and  an  odor  of  burning  were  left 
behind  in  the  patio.  I  remember  some  undamaged 
pages  lying  white  against  the  ground.  Nora  Erf- 
jord,  who  felt  for  don  Alejandro  that  love  which 
young  women  often  feel  for  older  men,  said,  with- 
out really  understanding,  "Don  Alejandro  knows 
what  he's  doing." 

Irala,  always  true  to  literature,  attempted  an  epi- 

46 


gram.  "Every  few  centuries,"  he  said,  "the  Library 
of  Alexandria  must  be  burned  down." 

Then  the  revelation  was  made  to  us. 

"It  has  taken  me  four  years  to  understand  what 
I  am  about  to  say,"  don  Alejandro  began.  "My 
friends,  the  undertaking  we  have  set  for  ourselves 
is  so  vast  that  it  embraces — I  now  see — the  whole 
world.  Our  Congress  cannot  be  a  group  of  charla- 
tans deafening  each  other  in  the  sheds  of  an  out- 
of-the-way  ranch.  The  Congress  of  the  World 
began  with  the  first  moment  of  the  world  and  it 
will  go  on  when  we  are  dust.  There's  no  place  on 
earth  where  it  does  not  exist.  The  Congress  is  the 
books  we've  burned.  The  Congress  is  Job  on  the 
ash  heap  and  Christ  on  the  Cross.  The  Congress  is 
that  worthless  boy  who  squanders  my  substance  on 
whores." 

I  could  not  hold  myself  back.  "Don  Alejandro," 
I  broke  in,  "I,  too,  am  to  blame.  I  had  finished  my 
report,  which  I  now  hand  you,  but  I  stayed  on  and 
on  in  England,  throwing  your  money  away  on  a 
woman." 

Don  Alejandro  went  on.  "I  had  already  guessed 
as  much,  Ferri.  The  Congress  is  my  cattle.  The 
Congress  is  the  cattle  I  have  sold  and  the  miles  of 
land  that  are  no  longer  mine." 

A  horror-stricken  voice  was  raised — Twirl's. 
"You  don't  mean  to  say  you've  sold  La  Caledonia?" 

"Yes,"  don  Alejandro  said  calmly,  "I've  sold  it.  I 
haven't  a  square  foot  of  land  to  my  name,  but  I  do 
not  regret  it,  because  now  I  see  things  as  they  are. 
Perhaps  we  shall  never  meet  again,  for  the 
Congress  stands  in  no  need  of  us.  But  this  last 
night  we  will  all  go  out  together  to  see  the  true 
Congress." 


47 


Drunk  with  victory,  he  overwhelmed  us  with  his 
resolution  and  faith.  No  one — not  for  a  single  sec- 
ond— thought  he  was  mad. 

In  the  square,  we  climbed  into  an  open  carriage. 
I  squeezed  myself  onto  the  driver's  seat  beside  the 
coachman,  and  don  Alejandro  ordered,  "Maestro, 
let's  have  a  turn  around  the  city.  Take  us  any- 
where you  like." 

The  Negro,  perched  on  the  running  board, 
never  stopped  smiling.  I'll  never  know  whether  or 
not  he  realized  what  was  going  on. 

Words  are  symbols  that  assume  a  shared  mem- 
ory. The  memory  I  now  want  to  set  down  is  mine 
alone;  all  those  who  share  it  have  died.  The  mys- 
tics invoke  a  rose,  a  kiss,  a  bird  that  is  all  birds,  a 
sun  that  is  all  the  stars  and  the  sun,  a  jug  of  wine, 
a  garden,  or  the  sexual  act.  Of  these  metaphors, 
none  will  serve  me  for  that  long,  joyous  night, 
which  left  us,  tired  out  and  happy,  at  the  borders 
of  dawn.  We  barely  spoke  while  the  wheels  and 
the  horses'  hooves  clattered  over  the  cobblestones. 
Before  daybreak,  beside  a  dark,  humble  body  of 
water  that  may  have  been  the  Maldonado  or  the 
Riachuelo,  Nora  Erfjord's  high  voice  sang  the  bal- 
lad of  Sir  Patrick  Spens,  and  don  Alejandro,  in  a 
low  voice  and  out  of  tune,  chimed  in  with  a  few 
verses.  The  English  words  did  not  bring  me  Bea- 
trice's image.  At  my  back,  Twirl  muttered,  "I 
wanted  to  do  evil  and  I  have  done  good." 

Something  of  what  we  glimpsed  lives  on — the 
reddish  wall  of  the  Recoleta  cemetery,  the  yellow 
wall  of  a  jail,  a  couple  of  men  dancing  together  at 
a  right-angled  street  corner,  a  church  courtyard 
with  black  and  white  tiles  and  a  grilled  iron  fence, 

48 


a  railway  gate  crossing,  my  house,  a  marketplace, 
the  damp  unfathomable  night — but  none  of  these 
fleeting  things,  which  may  have  been  others,  now 
matter.  What  really  matters  is  having  felt  that  our 
plan,  which  more  than  once  we  made  a  joke  of,  re- 
ally and  secretly  existed  and  was  the  world  and 
ourselves.  Down  through  the  years,  without  much 
hope,  I  have  sought  the  taste  of  that  night;  a  few 
times  I  thought  I  had  recaptured  it  in  music,  in 
love,  in  untrustworthy  memories,  but  it  has  never 
come  back  to  me  except  once  in  a  dream.  When 
we  swore  not  to  say  a  word  to  anyone,  it  was  al- 
ready Saturday  morning. 

I  never  saw  any  of  them  again,  outside  of  Irala. 
He  and  I  never  spoke  about  the  Congress;  any- 
thing we  might  have  said  would  have  been  a  dese- 
cration. In  1914,  don  Alejandro  Glencoe  died  and 
was  buried  in  Montevideo.  Irala  had  already 
passed  away  the  year  before. 

Once,  I  ran  across  Nierenstein  on  Lima  Street, 
and  we  pretended  not  to  see  each  other.

There  Are  More  Things 

To  the  memory  of  H.  P.  Lovecraft 


On  the  point  of  taking  my  last  examination  at  the 
University  of  Texas,  in  Austin,  I  learned  that  my 
uncle  Edwin  Arnett  had  died  of  an  aneurysm  at 
the  far  end  of  the  South  American  continent.  I  felt 
what  we  all  feel  when  someone  dies — the  remorse, 
now  pointless,  for  not  having  been  kinder.  We 
forget  that  we  are  all  dead  men  conversing  with 
dead  men.  My  course  of  study  was  philosophy.  I 
remembered  that  it  was  my  uncle,  at  the  Casa 
Colorada,  his  home  near  Lomas,  on  the  edge  of 
Buenos  Aires,  who,  without  invoking  a  single 
proper  name,  had  first  revealed  to  me  philoso- 
phy's beautiful  perplexities.  One  of  the  after- 
dinner  oranges  was  his  aid  in  initiating  me  into 
Berkeley's  idealism;  a  chessboard  was  enough  to  il- 
lustrate the  paradoxes  of  the  Eleatics.  Years  later, 
he  was  to  lend  me  Hinton's  treatises  which  attempt 
to  demonstrate  the  reality  of  four-dimensional 
space  and  which  the  reader  is  meant  to  imagine  by 
means  of  complicated  exercises  with  multicolored 
cubes.  I  shall  never  forget  the  prisms  and  pyra- 
mids that  we  erected  on  the  floor  of  his  study. 


51 


My  uncle  was  an  engineer.  Before  retiring  from 
his  job  with  the  railroad,  he  decided  to  build  him- 
self a  house  in  Turdera,  which  offered  the  advan- 
tages of  almost  countrylike  solitude  and  of  prox- 
imity to  the  city.  Nothing  was  more  predictable 
than  that  the  architect  should  be  his  close  friend 
Alexander  Muir.  This  uncompromising  man  fol- 
lowed the  uncompromising  teachings  of  John 
Knox.  My  uncle,  like  almost  all  the  gentlemen  of 
his  day,  had  been  a  freethinker  or,  rather,  an  ag- 
nostic, but  he  was  interested  in  theology,  just  as  he 
was  interested  in  Hinton's  unreal  cubes  and  in  the 
well-constructed  nightmares  of  the  young  H.  G. 
Wells.  He  liked  dogs,  and  he  had  a  great  sheepdog 
that  he  had  named  Samuel  Johnson,  in  memory  of 
Lichfield,  his  far-off  birthplace. 

The  Casa  Colorada  stood  on  a  height  of  land, 
bordered  on  the  west  by  sun-blackened  fields.  In- 
side its  fence,  the  araucarias  did  nothing  to  soften 
its  air  of  gloom.  Instead  of  a  flat  roof,  there  was  a 
slate-tiled  saddle  roof  and  a  square  tower  with  a 
clock.  These  seemed  to  oppress  the  walls  and  the 
meager  windows.  As  a  boy,  I  used  to  accept  all  this 
ugliness,  just  as  one  accepts  those  incompatible 
things  which,  only  because  they  coexist,  are  called 
the  world. 

I  returned  home  in  1921.  To  avoid  legal  compli- 
cations, the  house  had  been  auctioned  off.  It  was 
bought  by  a  foreigner,  a  Max  Preetorius,  who  paid 
double  what  was  offered  by  the  highest  bidder.  No 
sooner  was  the  deed  signed  than  he  arrived,  late 
one  afternoon,  with  two  helpers  and  they  carted 
off  to  a  rubbish  dump,  not  far  from  the  old  Dro- 
ver's Road,  all  the  furniture,  all  the  books,  and  all 
the  utensils  of  the  house.  (I  sadly  recalled  the  dia- 


52 


grams  in  the  Hinton  volumes  and  the  great  globe.) 
The  next  day,  Preetorius  went  to  Muir  and  pro- 
posed certain  alterations  that  the  architect  indig- 
nantly rejected.  In  the  end,  a  firm  from  Buenos 
Aires  took  charge  of  the  work.  The  local  carpen- 
ters refused  to  furnish  the  house  again.  Finally,  a 
certain  Mariani,  from  Glew,  accepted  the  condi- 
tions laid  down  by  Preetorius.  For  an  entire  fort- 
night he  had  to  labor  by  night  behind  closed  doors. 
It  was  also  bv  night  that  the  new  owner  of  the 
Casa  Colorada  moved  in.  The  windows  no  longer 
opened,  but  chinks  of  light  could  be  made  out  in 
the  dark.  One  morning,  the  milkman  found  the 
sheepdog  dead  on  the  walk,  headless  and  mutila- 
ted. That  winter  they  felled  the  araucarias.  No- 
body saw  Preetorius  again. 

News  of  these  events,  as  may  be  imagined,  left 
me  uneasy.  I  know  that  my  most  obvious  trait  is 
curiosity — that  same  curiosity  that  brought  me 
together  with  a  woman  completely  different  from 
me  only  in  order  to  find  out  who  she  was  and  what 
she  was  like,  to  take  up  (without  appreciable  re- 
sults) the  use  of  laudanum,  to  explore  transfinite 
numbers,  and  to  undertake  the  hideous  adventure 
that  I  am  about  to  tell.  Ominously,  I  decided  to 
look  into  the  matter. 

My  first  step  was  to  see  Alexander  Muir.  I  re- 
membered him  as  tall-standing  and  dark,  with  a 
wiry  build  that  suggested  strength.  Now  the  years 
had  stooped  him  and  his  black  beard  had  gone 
gray.  He  received  me  at  his  Temperley  house, 
which,  foreseeably,  was  like  my  uncle's,  since  both 
houses  followed  the  solid  standards  of  the  good 
poet  and  bad  builder  William  Morris. 

Conversation    was    spare — Scotland's    symbol, 


53 


after  all,  is  the  thistle.  I  had  the  feeling,  nonethe- 
less, that  the  strong  Ceylon  tea  and  the  equally 
generous  plate  of  scones  (which  my  host  broke  in 
two  and  buttered  for  me  as  if  I  were  still  a  boy) 
were,  in  fact,  a  frugal  Calvinistic  feast  offered  to 
the  nephew  of  his  friend.  His  theological  dif- 
ferences with  my  uncle  had  been  a  long  game  of 
chess,  demanding  of  each  player  the  collaboration 
of  his  opponent. 

Time  passed  and  I  was  no  nearer  my  business. 
There  was  an  uncomfortable  silence  and  Muir 
spoke.  "Young  man,"  he  said,  "you  have  not  come 
all  this  way  to  talk  about  Edwin  or  the  United 
States,  a  country  that  I  have  little  interest  in. 
What's  troubling  you  is  the  sale  of  the  Casa  Co- 
lorada  and  its  odd  buyer.  They  do  me,  too. 
Frankly,  the  story  displeases  me,  but  I'll  tell  you 
what  I  can.  It  will  not  be  much." 

After  a  while  he  went  on,  unhurriedly.  "Before 
Edwin  died,  the  mayor  called  me  into  his  office. 
He  was  with  the  parish  priest.  They  asked  me  to 
draw  the  plans  for  a  Catholic  chapel.  My  work 
would  be  well  paid.  On  the  spot,  I  answered  no.  I 
am  a  servant  of  God  and  I  cannot  commit  the 
abomination  of  erecting  altars  to  idols."  Here  he 
stopped. 

"Is  that  all?"  I  finally  dared  ask. 

"No.  This  whelp  of  a  Jew  Preetorius  wanted  me 
to  destroy  my  work  and  in  its  place  get  up  a  mon- 
strous thing.  Abomination  comes  in  many  shapes." 
He  pronounced  these  words  gravely  and  got  to  his 
feet. 

Outside,  on  turning  the  corner,  I  was  ap- 
proached by  Daniel  Iberra.  We  knew  one  another 
the  way  people  in  small  towns  do.  He  suggested 


54 


that  we  accompany  each  other  back  to  Turdera.  I 
have  never  been  keen  on  hoodlums,  and  I  ex- 
pected a  sordid  litany  of  violent  and  more  or  less 
apocryphal  back-room  stories,  but  I  gave  in  and 
accepted  his  invitation.  It  was  nearly  nightfall.  On 
seeing  the  Casa  Colorada  come  into  view  from  a 
few  blocks  off,  Iberra  made  a  detour.  I  asked  him 
why.  His  reply  was  not  what  I  anticipated. 

"I  am  don  Felipe's  right  arm,"  he  said.  "Nobody 
has  ever  called  me  soft.  That  young  Urgoiti  who 
took  the  trouble  to  come  looking  for  me  all  the 
way  from  Merlo — you  probably  remember  what 
happened  to  him.  Look.  A  few  nights  ago,  I  was 
returning  from  a  party.  A  hundred  yards  or  so 
from  that  house  I  saw  something.  My  horse  reared 
up,  and  if  I  hadn't  had  a  good  grip  on  him  and 
made  him  turn  down  an  alley,  maybe  I  wouldn't 
be  telling  this  story  now.  What  I  saw  justified  the 
horse's  fright."  Angrily,  Iberra  added  a  swear 
word. 

That  night  I  did  not  sleep.  Around  dawn,  I 
dreamed  about  an  engraving  that  I  had  never  seen 
before  or  that  I  had  seen  and  forgotten;  it  was  in 
the  style  of  Piranesi,  and  it  had  a  labyrinth  in  it.  It 
was  a  stone  amphitheater  ringed  by  cypresses, 
above  whose  tops  it  reached.  There  were  neither 
doors  nor  windows;  rather,  it  displayed  an  endless 
row  of  narrow  vertical  slits.  With  a  magnifying 
glass,  I  tried  to  see  the  Minotaur  inside.  At  last,  I 
made  it  out.  It  was  a  monster  of  a  monster,  more 
bison  than  bull,  and,  its  human  body  stretched  out 
on  the  ground,  it  seemed  to  be  asleep  and  dream- 
ing. Dreaming  of  what  or  of  whom? 

That  evening,  I  passed  by  the  Casa  Colorada. 
The  iron  gate  was  shut  and  some  of  its  bars  were 


55 


bent.  What  once  was  garden  was  now  overgrown 
with  weeds.  To  the  right,  there  was  a  shallow  ditch 
and  its  outer  edges  were  trampled. 

There  was  only  one  move  left,  but  for  days  I 
kept  putting  it  off — not  because  I  felt  it  to  be  al- 
together a  waste,  but  because  it  would  drag  me  to 
the  inevitable,  to  the  last. 

Without  much  hope,  I  went  to  Glew.  Mariani, 
the  carpenter,  was  a  stout,  pink-faced  Italian,  com- 
mon and  cordial  and  now  somewhat  advanced  in 
years.  A  glance  at  him  was  enough  for  me  to 
dismiss  the  stratagems  I  had  contrived  the  night 
before.  I  handed  him  my  card,  which  he  pomp- 
ously spelled  out  aloud  with  a  certain  reverential 
stumbling  when  he  reached  the  "Ph.D."  I  told  him 
I  was  interested  in  the  furniture  made  by  him  for 
the  house  in  Turdera  that  had  been  my  uncle's. 
The  man  spoke  on  and  on.  I  shall  not  try  to  tran- 
scribe his  torrent  of  words  and  gestures,  but  he 
told  me  that  his  motto  was  to  satisfy  his  customer's 
every  demand,  no  matter  how  outlandish  it  was, 
and  that  he  had  carried  out  his  work  to  the  letter. 
After  rummaging  in  various  drawers  he  showed 
me  some  papers  that  I  could  make  neither  head 
nor  tail  of;  they  were  signed  by  the  elusive  Pree- 
torius.  (Doubtless,  Mariani  mistook  me  for  a  law- 
yer.) On  saying  goodbye,  he  confided  to  me  that 
even  for  all  the  world's  gold  he  would  never  again 
set  foot  in  Turdera,  let  alone  that  house.  He 
added  that  the  customer  is  sacred,  but  that  in  his 
humble  opinion  Mr.  Preetorius  was  crazy.  Then 
he  grew  quiet,  obviously  repentant.  I  was  unable 
to  worm  anything  more  out  of  him. 

I  had  allowed  for  this  failure,  but  it  is  one  thing 
to  allow  for  something  and  quite  another  to  see  it 

56 


happen.  Time  and  again,  I  said  to  myself  that  the 
solution  of  this  enigma  did  not  concern  me  and 
that  the  one  true  enigma  was  time,  that  seamless 
chain  of  past,  present,  and  future,  of  the  ever  and 
the  never.  Such  reflections  turned  out  to  be  use- 
less, however;  after  whole  afternoons  devoted  to 
the  study  of  Schopenhauer  or  Royce,  night  after 
night  I  would  walk  the  dirt  roads  ringing  the  Casa 
Colorada.  Sometimes  I  caught  a  glimpse  upstairs 
of  a  very  white  light;  other  times,  I  thought  I 
heard  a  moaning.  It  went  on  this  way  until  the 
nineteenth  of  January. 

It  was  one  of  those  Buenos  Aires  days  when  a 
man  feels  himself  not  only  bullied  and  insulted  by 
the  summer  but  even  debased  by  it.  At  around 
eleven  o'clock  at  night  the  storm  broke.  First  came 
the  south  wind,  and  then  the  water  in  torrents.  I 
wandered  about  looking  for  a  tree.  In  the  sudden 
glare  of  a  lightning  flash  I  found  myself  a  few 
steps  from  the  fence.  Whether  out  of  fear  or  hope 
I  don't  know,  but  I  tried  the  gate.  Unexpectedly,  it 
opened.  I  made  my  way,  pushed  along  by  the 
storm.  Sky  and  earth  threatened  me.  The  door  of 
the  house  was  also  open.  A  squall  of  rain  lashed 
my  face  and  I  went  in. 

Inside,  the  floor  tiles  had  been  torn  up  and  I 
stepped  on  matted  grass.  A  sweet,  sickening  smell 
filled  the  house.  Right  or  left,  I'm  not  sure  which, 
I  tripped  on  a  stone  ramp.  Quickly,  I  went  up.  Al- 
most unawares,  I  turned  on  the  light  switch. 

The  dining  room  and  the  library  of  my  memo- 
ries were  now,  with  the  wall  between  them  torn 
down,  a  single  great  bare  room  containing  one  or 
two  pieces  of  furniture.  I  shall  not  try  to  describe 
them,  since  I  am  not  altogether  sure — in  spite  of 


57 


the  cruel  white  light — of  having  seen  them.  Let  me 
explain  myself.  To  see  a  thing  one  has  to  compre- 
hend it.  An  armchair  presupposes  the  human 
body,  its  joints  and  limbs;  a  pair  of  scissors,  the  act 
of  cutting.  What  can  be  said  of  a  lamp  or  a  car? 
The  savage  cannot  comprehend  the  missionary's 
Bible;  the  passenger  does  not  see  the  same  rigging 
as  the  sailors.  If  we  really  saw  the  world,  maybe  we 
would  understand  it. 

None  of  the  meaningless  shapes  that  that  night 
granted  me  corresponded  to  the  human  figure  or, 
for  that  matter,  to  any  conceivable  use.  I  felt  revul- 
sion and  terror.  In  one  of  the  corners,  I  found  a 
ladder  which  led  to  the  upper  floor.  The  spaces 
between  the  iron  rungs,  which  were  no  more  than 
ten,  were  wide  and  irregular.  That  ladder,  imply- 
ing hands  and  feet,  was  comprehensible,  and  in 
some  way  this  relieved  me.  I  put  out  the  light  and 
waited  for  some  time  in  the  dark.  I  did  not  hear 
the  least  sound,  but  the  presence  there  of  in- 
comprehensible things  disquieted  me.  In  the  end, 
I  made  up  my  mind. 

Once  upstairs,  my  fearful  hand  switched  on  the 
light  a  second  time.  The  nightmare  that  had  fore- 
shadowed the  lower  floor  came  alive  and  flowered 
on  the  next.  Here  there  were  either  many  objects 
or  a  few  linked  together.  I  now  recall  a  sort  of 
long  operating  table,  very  high  and  in  the  shape  of 
a  U,  with  round  hollows  at  each  end.  I  thought 
that  maybe  it  was  the  bed  of  the  house's  inhabi- 
tant, whose  monstrous  anatomy  revealed  itself  in 
this  way,  implicitly,  like  an  animal's  or  a  god's  by 
its  shadow.  From  some  page  or  other  of  Lucan 
there  came  to  my  lips  the  word  "amphisbaena," 
which  hinted  at,  but  which  certainly  did  not  ex- 


58 


haust,  what  my  eyes  were  later  to  see.  I  also  re- 
member a  V  of  mirrors  that  became  lost  in  the 
upper  darkness. 

What  would  the  inhabitant  be  like?  What  could 
it  be  looking  for  on  this  planet,  no  less  hideous  to 
it  than  it  to  us?  From  what  secret  regions  of  as- 
tronomy or  time,  from  what  ancient  and  now  in- 
calculable dusk  can  it  have  reached  this  South 
American  suburb  and  this  particular  night? 

I  felt  an  intruder  in  the  chaos.  Outside,  the  rain 
had  stopped.  I  looked  at  my  watch  and  saw  with 
astonishment  that  it  was  almost  two  o'clock.  I  left 
the  light  on  and  carefully  began  climbing  down. 
To  get  down  the  way  I  had  come  up  was  not  im- 
possible— to  get  down  before  the  inhabitant  re- 
turned. I  guessed  that  it  had  not  locked  the  doors 
because  it  did  not  know  how. 

My  feet  were  touching  the  next  to  last  rung  of 
the  ladder  when  I  felt  that  something,  slow  and 
oppressive  and  twofold,  was  coming  up  the  ramp. 
Curiosity  overcame  my  fear,  and  I  did  not  shut  my 
eyes.

The  Sect  of  the  Thirty 


The  original  manuscript  may  be  consulted  at  the 
University  of  Leiden;  the  text  is  in  Latin,  but  one 
or  two  Hellenisms  justify  the  conjecture  that  it  was 
translated  from  the  Greek.  According  to  Lei- 
segang,  it  dates  from  the  fourth  century  a.d.  Gib- 
bon mentions  it  in  passing  in  one  of  the  footnotes 
to  the  fifteenth  chapter  of  his  Decline  and  Fall.  The 
anonymous  author  has  recorded: 

.  .  .  The  Sect  was  never  large,  and  now  its  pros- 
elytes number  but  a  scant  few.  Decimated  by 
sword  and  fire,  they  sleep  by  the  wayside  or,  since 
it  is  forbidden  them  to  build  any  form  of  dwelling 
place,  among  the  ruins  spared  by  war.  They  also 
journey  about  quite  naked.  These  facts  are  com- 
mon knowledge.  My  aim  here  is  to  leave  a  written 
record  of  what  it  has  been  vouchsafed  me  to  dis- 
cover of  the  Sect's  beliefs  and  customs.  I  have 
argued  at  length  with  its  masters  and  have  met 
with  little  success  in  converting  them  to  the  Faith 
of  Our  Lord. 

The  first  thing  about  the  Sect  that  drew  my  at- 

61 


tention  was  the  variousness  of  its  notions  regard- 
ing the  dead.  Among  the  most  ignorant,  for  ex- 
ample, it  is  held  that  the  burial  of  those  who  have 
departed  this  life  is  entrusted  to  their  spirits;  oth- 
ers, the  unorthodox,  maintain  that  Jesus'  admoni- 
tion to  "let  the  dead  bury  their  dead"  is  meant  to 
condemn  the  pompous  vanity  of  our  funeral  rites. 

The  advice  to  sell  what  one  has  and  give  to  the 
poor  is  closely  followed  by  every  sectarian;  those 
so  benefited  give  to  others  and  these,  in  turn,  to 
still  others.  This  should  suffice  to  explain  their  in- 
digence and  nakedness,  which,  in  addition,  brings 
them  nearer  the  state  of  paradise.  Fervently  they 
repeat  the  words,  "Behold  the  ravens  of  the  air: 
for  they  sow  not,  neither  do  they  reap,  nor  have 
they  barns  or  sheds;  yet  your  heavenly  Father 
feedeth  them.  Are  ye  not  much  better  than  they?" 
Their  teaching  forbids  all  saving:  "Wherefore,  if 
God  so  clothe  the  grass  of  the  field,  which  to  day 
is,  and  to  morrow  is  cast  into  the  oven,  shall  he  not 
much  more  clothe  you,  O  ye  of  little  faith?  There- 
fore take  no  thought,  saying,  What  shall  we  eat? 
or,  What  shall  we  drink?" 

The  judgment  "whosoever  looketh  on  a  woman 
to  lust  after  her  hath  committed  adultery  with  her 
already  in  his  heart"  is  a  piece  of  straightforward 
advice  about  maintaining  purity.  Yet,  many  are 
the  members  of  the  Sect  who  point  out  that  if 
there  is  not  one  man  on  earth  who  has  not  looked 
upon  a  woman  to  lust  after  her  all  men  have  com- 
mitted adultery.  Since  the  desire  is  as  sinful  as  the 
act,  the  righteous  may  without  risk  indulge  in  the 
most  outrageous  lust. 

The  Sect  shuns  temples;  its  elders  preach  in  the 

62 


open  air,  from  the  top  of  a  hill  or  a  wall,  or  some- 
times from  a  boat  on  the  shore. 

The  Sect's  name  has  given  rise  to  persistent  con- 
jectures. One  such  suggests  that  it  refers  to  the 
number  to  which  the  faithful  have  been  reduced, 
which  is  ridiculous  and  yet  prophetic,  because,  due 
to  its  perverse  set  of  beliefs,  the  Sect  is  destined  to 
die  out.  Another  conjecture  is  that  the  name 
derives  from  the  height  of  the  Ark,  which  was 
thirty  cubits;  another,  which  distorts  the  calendar, 
from  the  number  of  nights  that  make  up  a  lunar 
month;  another,  from  the  Savior's  age  at  baptism; 
another,  from  Adam's  years  when  he  rose  out  of 
the  red  dust  of  the  ground.  All  are  equally  untrue. 
No  less  deceiving  is  the  list  of  thirty  godheads  or 
thrones,  of  which  one  is  Abraxas,  portrayed  by  a 
cock's  head,  the  arms  and  torso  of  a  man,  and  the 
tail  of  an  entwined  serpent. 

The  priceless  gift  of  communicating  Truth  has 
not  been  granted  me.  One  knows  the  Truth  but  is 
unable  to  argue  it.  May  others  more  gifted  than  I 
save  the  members  of  the  Sect  by  preaching — by 
preaching  or  by  fire,  for  it  is  better  to  be  put  to 
death  than  to  commit  suicide.  I  shall  therefore 
limit  myself  to  giving  an  account  of  the  abomina- 
ble heresy. 

The  Word  was  made  flesh  to  become  a  man 
among  men,  who  would  deliver  Him  up  to  the 
cross  and  be  redeemed  by  Him.  He  was  born  of 
the  womb  of  a  woman  of  the  chosen  people  not 
only  to  preach  Love,  but  to  suffer  martyrdom. 

It  was  necessary  that  events  be  unforgettable. 
The  death  of  a  human  being  by  the  sword  or  by 
drinking  hemlock  was   not  enough   to   move  the 

63 


imagination  of  mankind  to  the  end  of  time.  The 
Lord  arranged  things  in  a  dramatic  way.  This  ac- 
counts for  the  Last  Supper,  for  Jesus'  words  that 
foretold  his  betrayal,  for  the  repeated  warning  to 
one  of  the  disciples,  for  the  blessing  of  the  bread 
and  wine,  for  Peter's  pledges,  for  the  solitary  vigil 
in  the  garden  of  Gethsemane,  for  the  sleep  of  the 
twelve  disciples,  for  the  Son  of  God's  human 
prayer,  for  the  sweat  like  blood,  for  the  multitude 
with  swords  and  staves,  for  the  kiss  of  betrayal,  for 
Pilate's  washing  his  hands,  for  the  scourging,  for 
the  mocking,  for  the  crown  of  thorns,  for  the  pur- 
ple robe  and  reed  scepter,  for  the  vinegar  with 
gall,  for  the  cross  on  the  summit  of  a  hill,  for  the 
promise  to  the  repentant  thief,  for  the  earth  that 
shook  and  the  darkness  over  all  the  land. 

Divine  Providence,  to  which  I  owe  so  many  bless- 
ings, has  allowed  me  to  discover  the  real  and  se- 
cret reason  for  the  Sect's  name.  In  Kerioth,  where 
in  all  likelihood  it  originated,  there  survives  a  con- 
venticle known  as  the  Thirty  Coins.  This  was  the 
earliest  name,  and  it  gives  us  the  clue.  In  the 
drama  of  the  Cross  (I  mean  this  with  due  rever- 
ence) there  were  intentional  and  unintentional  ac- 
tors— all  of  them  indispensable,  all  of  them  fatal. 
Unintentional  were  the  priests  who  handed  out 
the  pieces  of  silver,  unintentional  was  the  multi- 
tude that  asked  for  Barabbas,  unintentional  was 
the  Governor  of  Judea,  unintentional  were  the 
Roman  soldiers  who  erected  the  cross  of  His  mar- 
tyrdom and  nailed  the  nails  and  cast  lots  for  His 
garments.  The  intentional  actors  were  only  two — 
the  Redeemer  and  Judas.  The  latter  cast  down  the 
thirty  pieces  of  silver  that  were  the  price  of  Salva- 
tion and  went  and  hanged  himself.  At  the  time, 

64 


like  the  Son  of  Man,  he  was  thirty-three  years  old. 
The  Sect  worships  them  equally  and  absolves  all 
the  others.  There  is  no  one  culprit.  Everyone,  un- 
witting or  not,  is  an  agent  in  the  scheme  laid  down 
by  Divine  Wisdom.  All  of  them  now  share  the 
Glory. 

My  hand  trembles  to  set  down  yet  another 
abomination.  In  order  to  follow  the  example  of 
their  masters,  the  believers,  upon  attaining  the 
designated  age,  have  themselves  mocked  and  cru- 
cified on  the  summit  of  a  hill.  This  criminal  viola- 
tion of  the  Fifth  Commandment  must  be  brought 
to  an  end  with  all  the  severity  that  human  and 
divine  laws  have  always  demanded.  May  the  curses 
of  the  skies,  may  the  hatred  of  the  angels  .   .   . 

No  more  of  the  manuscript  has  been  unearthed.

The  Night  of  the  Gifts 


It  was  many  years  ago  in  the  old  Confiteria  del 
Aguila,  on  Florida  Street  up  around  Piedad,  that 
we  heard  this  story.  The  problem  of  knowledge 
was  being  discussed.  Someone  invoked  the  pla- 
tonic  theory  that  we  have  already  seen  everything 
in  a  previous  world,  so  that  to  know  is  to  know 
again.  My  father,  I  believe,  said  that  Bacon  had 
written  that  if  to  learn  is  to  remember,  not  to 
know  is  in  fact  to  have  forgotten.  Another  person, 
a  man  getting  on  in  years,  who  was  probably  a  bit 
lost  in  metaphysics,  decided  to  enter  in.  Speaking 
slowly  and  deliberately,  this  is  what  he  told  us: 

Frankly,  I  don't  understand  all  this  talk  of  pla- 
tonic  archetypes.  Nobody  remembers  the  first  time 
he  saw  the  color  yellow  or  black,  or  the  first  time 
he  tasted  a  certain  fruit — maybe  because  he  was 
small  then  and  had  no  way  of  knowing  he  was  ini- 
tiating a  very  long  series.  Of  course,  there  are 
other  first  times  that  no  one  forgets.  I  can  tell  you 
what  a  certain  night  of  my  life  gave  me,  one  I 
often  recall — the  night  of  the  thirtieth  of  April, 

1874. 


67 


Summer  holidays  were  much  longer  then,  but  I 
don't  know  why  we  stayed  away  from  Buenos 
Aires  until  that  late  date.  We  were  at  the  ranch  of 
some  cousins,  the  Dornas,  not  far  from  Lobos. 
During  that  time,  one  of  the  cowhands,  Rufino, 
initiated  me  into  country  things.  I  was  approach- 
ing thirteen;  he  was  somewhat  older  and  had  a 
reputation  as  a  daredevil.  He  was  quick,  agile. 
When  the  younger  hands  played  at  knife-fighting 
with  burnt  sticks,  the  one  who  always  got  his  face 
marked  was  Rufino's  opponent.  One  Friday,  Ru- 
fino suggested  we  go  into  town  the  next  night  to 
have  a  little  fun.  Of  course,  I  leaped  at  the  chance, 
but  without  really  knowing  what  it  was  all  about.  I 
warned  him  I  didn't  know  how  to  dance.  Dancing 
was  easy  to  learn,  he  said. 

After  dinner  on  Saturday,  at  around  seven- 
thirty,  we  set  off.  Rufino  had  rigged  himself  out 
like  someone  going  to  a  party,  and  he  wore  a  silver 
knife  in  his  belt.  I  had  a  little  knife  like  it,  but  I 
didn't  bring  mine  for  fear  of  being  laughed  at.  It 
was  not  long  before  we  glimpsed  the  first  houses.  I 
don't  suppose  any  of  you  has  ever  been  to  Lobos. 
Not  that  it  matters.  There's  no  small  town  in  the 
Argentine  that  isn't  exactly  like  all  the  others — 
even  to  the  point  of  thinking  itself  different.  Each 
has  the  same  unpaved  alleys,  the  same  empty  lots, 
the  same  one-story  houses — all  of  which  make  a 
man  on  horseback  seem  more  important. 

We  dismounted  at  a  certain  street  corner  in 
front  of  a  house  painted  sky-blue  or  pink,  with  a 
sign  saying  "La  Estrella."  Tied  to  the  hitching  post 
were  some  horses  with  good  saddles.  Through  the 
half-open  street  door  I  saw  a  shaft  of  light.  At  the 
end  of  the  entranceway  was  a  large  room   with 


68 


wooden  benches  on  either  side  and,  between  the 
benches,  a  number  of  dark  doors  that  opened  who 
knew  where.  A  little  mongrel  with  yellow  fur  ran 
up  barking  to  welcome  me.  Quite  a  few  people 
were  about,  and  a  half  dozen  or  so  women  in 
floral  dressing  gowns  came  and  went.  A  respec- 
table-looking lady,  dressed  in  black  from  head  to 
foot,  seemed  to  be  the  owner  of  the  house.  Rufino 
greeted  her,  saying,  "I've  brought  a  new  friend, 
but  he's  not  much  of  a  rider." 

"Don't  worry,"  the  woman  answered.  "He'll 
learn  soon  enough." 

I  felt  ashamed.  To  draw  their  attention  away,  or 
to  make  them  see  that  I  was  a  boy,  I  began  playing 
with  the  dog  at  the  end  of  one  of  the  benches.  On 
a  table  in  the  kitchen  burned  some  cheap  candles  in 
bottles,  and  I  also  remember  a  small  brazier  in  a 
corner  to  the  rear.  On  the  whitewashed  wall  op- 
posite was  a  picture  of  Our  Lady  of  Mercy. 

Somebody,  between  one  joke  and  another,  was 
tuning  a  guitar  that  gave  him  a  lot  of  trouble.  Out 
of  sheer  timidity  I  did  not  refuse  a  gin,  which 
burned  my  mouth  like  a  red-hot  coal.  Among  the 
women  I  noticed  one" who  seemed  different  from 
the  others.  They  called  her  La  Cautiva — the  Cap- 
tive. There  was  something  Indian  about  her,  but 
her  features  were  like  a  picture  and  her  eyes  very 
sad.  Her  braided  hair  reached  her  waist.  Rufino 
saw  that  I  was  looking  at  her. 

"Let's  hear  about  the  raid  again — to  refresh  our 
memories,"  he  said  to  her. 

The  girl  spoke  as  if  she  were  alone,  and  in  some 
way  I  felt  that  she  was  unable  to  think  of  anything 
else  and  that  the  story  she  told  us  was  the  only 
thing  that  had  happened  to  her  in  her  life. 

69 


"I  was  very  young  when  they  brought  me  from 
Catamarca,"  she  said.  "What  did  I  know  about  In- 
dian raids?  At  Santa  Irene  we  didn't  even  mention 
such  things,  we  were  so  scared.  As  if  unraveling  a 
secret,  I  gradually  found  out  that  Indians  could 
descend  like  a  cloud  and  kill  people  and  steal  their 
stock.  Women  they  carried  off  into  the  pampa, 
and  they  did  everything  to  them.  I  tried  as  hard  as 
I  could  not  to  believe  any  of  this.  My  brother 
Lucas — the  Indians  later  put  a  spear  through 
him — swore  it  was  all  lies,  but  when  a  thing  is  true 
it  has  to  be  said  only  once  for  you  to  know  it's  so. 
The  government  hands  out  strong  drink  and 
yerba  to  keep  the  Indians  happy,  but  they  have 
very  clever  wizards  telling  them  what  to  do.  At  the 
word  of  one  of  their  chiefs,  it's  nothing  for  them 
to  attack  a  ranch  somewhere  out  between  the 
forts,  which  are  far  apart.  Just  from  thinking 
about  it  so  much,  I  almost  wished  they  would 
come,  and  I  knew  how  to  look  for  them  out  to- 
ward the  setting  sun.  I  don't  know  how  much  time 
went  by,  but  there  were  frosts  and  summers  and 
roundups  and  the  death  of  the  foreman's  son  be- 
fore the  raid." 

She  paused  for  a  moment  or  two,  lost  in 
thought,  then  went  on.  "It  was  as  if  the  south  wind 
brought  them.  I  saw  a  thistle  in  a  ditch,  and  that 
night  I  dreamed  of  Indians.  It  happened  at  day- 
break. The  animals  knew  it  before  we  did — the 
same  as  when  there's  an  earthquake.  The  cattle 
were  restless  and  birds  wheeled  in  the  sky.  We  ran 
to  look  in  the  direction  I  always  looked." 

"Who  warned  you?"  someone  asked. 

Distant  as  ever,  the  girl  repeated  her  last  sen- 
tence. "We  ran  to  look  in  the  direction  I  always 


70 


looked.  It  was  as  if  the  whole  desert  had  begun  to 
move.  Through  the  bars  of  the  window  grille  we 
saw  the  cloud  of  dust  before  we  saw  them.  It  was  a 
raiding  party.  They  beat  their  hands  over  their 
mouths,  whooping.  We  had  some  rifles  at  Santa 
Irene,  but  all  they  were  good  for  was  making  noise 
and  turning  the  Indians  even  more  savage." 

La  Cautiva  spoke  like  someone  saying  a  prayer 
she  had  learned  by  heart,  but  out  in  the  street  I 
heard  the  desert  Indians  and  their  war  cries. 
There  was  an  eruption  and,  as  if  riding  in  on 
horseback  in  the  fragments  of  some  dream,  they 
were  there  in  the  room.  They  were  local  toughs 
and  they  were  drunk.  Now,  in  my  memory,  I  see 
them  as  very  tall.  The  one  who  came  in  at  the 
head  of  them  elbowed  past  Rufino,  who  stood  by 
the  door.  Rufino  changed  color  and  got  out  of  the 
way.  The  lady  in  black,  who  had  not  stirred  from 
her  place,  rose  to  her  feet. 

"It's  Juan  Moreira!"  she  said. 

After  so  much  time,  I  no  longer  know  whether  I 
remember  the  man  of  that  night — the  outlaw 
Moreira — or  somebody  else  I  was  later  often  to  see 
around  cattle  fairs.  The  long,  thick  hair  and  black 
beard  of  stage  characters  based  on  Moreira  come 
to  mind,  but  I  also  recall  a  ruddy  face  pitted  by 
smallpox.  The  little  dog  scurried  forward  to  give 
him  a  welcome.  With  a  single  whiplash,  Moreira 
left  it  in  a  sprawl  on  the  floor.  It  lay  on  its  back 
and  died  pawing  the  air.  This  is  where  my  story 
really  begins. 

Without  a  sound  I  made  my  way  to  one  of  the 
doors,  which  opened  into  a  narrow  passageway 
and  a  staircase.  On  the  upper  floor,  I  hid  myself  in 
a  dark  room.  Apart  from  the  bed,  which  was  very 


71 


low,  I  never  knew  what  other  furniture  was  there. 
I  was  trembling.  Below,  the  shouting  did  not  let 
up,  and  there  was  a  shattering  of  glass.  I  heard  a 
woman's  footsteps  coming  up  the  stairs  and  I  saw 
a  momentary  slit  of  light.  Then  La  Cautiva's  voice 
called  out  to  me  in  a  whisper.  "I'm  here  to  serve — 
but  to  serve  peaceable  people,"  she  said.  "Come 
closer,  I'm  not  going  to  hurt  you." 

She  had  taken  off  her  dressing  gown.  I  lay  be- 
side her  and  felt  for  her  face  with  my  hands.  I 
have  no  idea  how  much  time  passed.  We  ex- 
changed neither  a  word  nor  a  kiss.  I  untied  her 
braid,  and  my  hands  played  with  her  hair,  which 
was  very  straight,  and  then  they  played  with  her. 
We  did  not  see  each  other  again  after  that,  and  I 
never  learned  her  real  name. 

A  shot  startled  us.  La  Cautiva  said,  "You  can 
leave  by  the  other  stairway." 

I  did,  and  I  found  myself  out  in  the  dirt  alley.  It 
was  a  moonlit  night.  A  police  sergeant,  Andres 
Chirino,  stood  on  watch  by  the  wall  with  a  rifle 
and  fixed  bayonet.  He  laughed,  saying  to  me,  "I 
see  you're  an  early  riser." 

I  must  have  answered  something,  but  he  paid 
me  no  attention.  A  man  was  lowering  himself  over 
the  wall.  With  a  bound,  the  sergeant  buried  the 
steel  in  his  flesh.  The  man  dropped  to  the  ground, 
where  he  lay  on  his  back,  moaning  and  bleeding  to 
death.  I  remembered  the  dog.  To  finish  the  man 
off  once  and  for  all,  Chirino  sank  the  bayonet  in 
again. 

"You  didn't  make  it  this  time,  Moreira,"  he  said 
almost  joyously. 

From  every  side  came  uniformed  men,  who  had 
surrounded  the  house,  and  then  the  neighbors. 


72 


The  sergeant  had  a  struggle  to  pull  out  the  bayo- 
net. Everybody  wanted  to  shake  his  hand. 

"The  fancy  footwork's  all  over  for  this  hood- 
lum," Rufino  said  with  a  laugh. 

I  went  from  group  to  group,  telling  people  what 
I  had  seen.  Then,  all  at  once,  I  felt  very  tired; 
maybe  I  was  even  feverish.  Slipping  away,  I  found 
Rufino  and  we  started  home.  From  our  horses,  we 
saw  the  pale  dawn  light.  More  than  tired,  I  felt 
dazed  by  that  torrent  of  events. 

"By  the  great  river  of  that  night,"  my  father  said 
when  the  man  had  finished. 

"That's  right,"  he  agreed.  "In  the  bare  space  of 
a  few  hours  I  had  known  love  and  had  looked  on 
death.  All  things  are  revealed  to  all  men — or,  any- 
way, all  those  things  it's  granted  a  man  to  know — 
but  to  me  two  fundamental  things  were  revealed 
in  a  single  night.  The  years  pass  and  I've  told  this 
story  so  many  times  I  no  longer  know  whether  I 
remember  it  as  it  was  or  whether  it's  only  my 
words  I'm  remembering.  Maybe  the  same  thing 
happened  to  La  Cautiva  with  her  Indian  raid.  It 
doesn't  matter  now  whether  it  was  I  or  someone 
else  who  saw  Moreira  killed."

The  Mirror 
and  the  Mask 


The  battle  of  Clontarf  over,  in  which  the  Nor- 
wegians met  defeat,  the  High  King  of  Ireland 
spoke  to  his  court  poet.  "The  greatest  deeds  lose 
their  luster  if  they  are  not  coined  in  words,"  the 
king  said.  "I  want  you  to  sing  my  victory  and  my 
praise.  I  will  be  Aeneas;  you  will  be  my  Virgil.  Do 
you  think  yourself  capable  of  this  task,  which  will 
make  us  both  immortal?" 

"Yes,  my  lord,"  said  the  bard.  "I  am  Ollan.  For 
twelve  winters  I  have  trained  in  the  disciplines  of 
prosody.  I  know  by  heart  the  three  hundred  and 
sixty  legends  that  form  the  basis  of  true  poetry. 
The  cycles  of  Ulster  and  Munster  are  in  the  strings 
of  my  harp.  The  laws  authorize  me  to  be  lavish  in 
using  the  oldest  words  of  our  tongue  and  the  most 
complex  metaphors.  I  have  mastered  the  secret  of 
writing,  which  protects  our  art  from  the  undis- 
cerning  eyes  of  the  common  herd.  I  can  celebrate 
loves,  cattle  thieves,  voyages,  and  wars.  I  know  the 
mythological  lineages  of  all  the  royal  houses  of 
Ireland.  I  possess  a  knowledge  of  judicial  astrol- 
ogy, mathematics,  canon  law,  and  the  powers  of 


75 


plants.  I  have  defeated  my  rivals  in  public  contest. 
I  have  made  myself  skilled  in  satire,  which  causes 
infirmities  of  the  skin,  including  leprosy.  I  know 
how  to  wield  a  sword,  as  I  proved  in  your  battle.  I 
am  ignorant  of  only  one  thing — how  to  thank  you 
for  the  gift  you  make  me." 

The  king,  who  was  easily  tired  by  long  speeches, 
especially  those  of  others,  said  with  relief,  "I  know 
these  things  quite  well.  I  have  been  told  that  the 
nightingale  recently  sang  in  England.  When  the 
rains  and  snows  pass,  and  the  nightingale  returns 
from  its  southern  lands,  you  will  sing  your  praises 
before  the  court  and  before  the  School  of  Bards.  I 
grant  you  a  whole  year.  You  will  polish  each  word 
and  letter.  Reward,  as  you  know  by  now,  will  not 
be  unworthy  of  my  royal  custom  nor  of  the  sleep- 
less nights  of  your  inspiration." 

"O  king,  what  greater  reward  than  to  see  your 
face!"  said  the  poet,  who  was  also  a  courtier.  He 
bowed  and  withdrew,  already  glimpsing  one  or 
two  verses. 

When  the  year  came  round — it  had  been  a  time 
of  epidemics  and  uprisings — the  poet  presented 
his  panegyric.  He  declaimed  it  slowly,  confidently, 
without  a  glance  at  the  manuscript.  With  his  head 
the  king  showed  his  approval.  Everyone  imitated 
his  gesture,  even  those  thronging  the  doorways, 
who  were  unable  to  make  otit  a  single  word.  At  the 
end  the  king  spoke. 

"I  accept  your  labor,"  he  said.  "It  is  another  vic- 
tory. You  have  given  each  word  its  true  meaning, 
and  each  substantive  the  epithet  given  it  by  the 
poets  of  old.  In  your  whole  panegyric  there  is  not 
a  single  image  unknown  to  the  classics.  War  is  the 
beautiful  web  of  men,  and  blood  is  the  sword's 


76 


water.  The  sea  has  its  gods  and  the  clouds  foretell 
the  future.  You  have  skillfully  handled  rhyme,  allit- 
eration, assonance,  quantities,  the  artifices  of 
learned  rhetoric,  the  wise  variation  of  meters.  If 
all  the  literature  of  Ireland  were  to  perish — absit 
omen — it  could  be  reconstructed  without  loss  from 
your  classic  ode.  Thirty  scribes  shall  copy  it  twelve 
times  each." 

There  was  a  silence,  then  he  went  on.  "All  is  well 
and  yet  nothing  has  happened.  In  our  veins  the 
blood  runs  no  faster.  Our  hands  have  not  sought 
the  bow.  No  one  has  turned  pale.  No  one  uttered 
a  battle  cry  or  set  his  breast  against  the  Vikings. 
Before  a  year  is  out,  poet,  we  shall  applaud  an- 
other ode.  As  a  sign  of  our  approval,  take  this  mir- 
ror, which  is  of  silver." 

"I  give  thanks  and  I  understand,"  said  the  bard. 

The  stars  in  the  sky  went  on  in  their  bright 
course.  Once  more  the  nightingale  sang  in  the 
Saxon  forests,  and  the  poet  came  back  with  his 
manuscript,  which  was  shorter  than  the  one  be- 
fore. He  did  not  repeat  it  from  memory  but  read 
it,  obviously  hesitant,  omitting  certain  passages  as 
if  he  himself  did  not  completely  understand  them 
or  did  not  wish  to  profane  them.  The  ode  was 
strange.  It  was  not  a  description  of  the  battle — it 
was  the  battle.  In  its  warlike  chaos  there  struggled 
with  one  another  the  God  that  is  Three  and  is 
One,  Ireland's  pagan  deities,  and  those  who  would 
wage  war  hundreds  of  years  later  at  the  beginning 
of  the  Elder  Edda.  The  form  was  no  less  odd.  A 
singular  noun  governed  a  plural  verb.  The  prepo- 
sitions were  alien  to  common  usage.  Harshness  al- 
ternated with  sweetness.  The  metaphors  were  ar- 
bitrary, or  so  they  seemed. 


77 


The  king  exchanged  a  few  words  with  the  men 
of  letters  who  stood  around  him,  then  spoke  to  the 
bard.  "Your  first  ode  I  could  declare  was  an  apt 
compendium  of  all  that  has  been  sung  in  Ireland," 
the  king  said.  "This  one  outdoes,  and  even  makes 
as  nothing,  whatever  came  before  it.  It  astounds,  it 
dazzles,  it  causes  wonderment.  The  ignorant  will 
be  unworthy  of  it,  but  not  so  the  learned,  the  few. 
An  ivory  casket  will  be  the  resting  place  of  its  sin- 
gle copy.  Of  the  pen  that  has  produced  so  eminent 
a  work  we  may  expect  one  still  more  lofty."  He 
added  with  a  smile,  "We  are  the  figures  of  a  fable, 
and  it  is  good  to  remember  that  in  fables  the 
number  three  prevails." 

"The  wizard's  three  gifts,  triads,  and  the  un- 
questionable Trinity,"  the  bard  made  bold  to  mur- 
mur. 

The  king  continued,  "As  a  token  of  our  ap- 
proval, take  this  golden  mask." 

"I  give  thanks  and  I  have  understood,"  said  the 
bard. 

The  anniversary  came  round  again.  The  palace 
sentries  noticed  that  the  poet  carried  no  manu- 
script. In  amazement,  the  king  looked  at  him;  the 
bard  was  like  another  man.  Something  other  than 
time  had  furrowed  and  transformed  his  features. 
His  eyes  seemed  to  stare  into  the  distance  or  to  be 
blind.  The  bard  begged  to  be  allowed  a  few  words 
with  the  king.  The  slaves  left  the  chamber. 

"Have  you  not  written  the  ode?"  asked  the  king. 

"Yes,"  the  bard  sadly  replied.  "But  would  that 
Christ  Our  Lord  had  prevented  me!" 

"Can  you  repeat  it?" 

"I  dare  not." 


78 


"I  will  give  you  the  courage  you  lack,"  said  the 
king. 

The  bard  recited  the  poem.  It  consisted  of  a 
single  line. 

Not  venturing  to  repeat  it  aloud,  the  poet  and 
his  king  savored  it  as  if  it  were  a  secret  prayer  or  a 
blasphemy.  The  king  was  as  awestricken  and  over- 
come as  the  bard.  The  two  looked  at  each  other, 
very  pale. 

"In  my  youth,"  said  the  king,  "I  sailed  toward 
the  sunset.  On  one  island  I  saw  silver  hounds  that 
dealt  death  to  golden  boars.  On  another  we  fed 
ourselves  on  the  fragrance  of  magic  apples.  On  a 
third  I  saw  walls  of  fire.  On  the  farthest  island  of 
all  an  arched  and  hanging  river  cut  across  the  sky 
and  in  its  waters  went  fishes  and  boats.  These  are 
wonders,  but  they  do  not  compare  with  your 
poem,  which  in  some  way  encompasses  them  all. 
What  bewitchery  gave  it  to  you?" 

"In  the  dawn  I  woke  up  speaking  words  I  did 
not  at  first  understand,"  said  the  bard.  "Those 
words  were  a  poem.  I  felt  I  had  committed  a  sin, 
perhaps  one  the  Holy  Ghost  does  not  forgive." 

"The  one  we  two  now  share,"  the  king  said  in  a 
whisper.  "The  sin  of  having  known  Beauty,  which 
is  a  gift  forbidden  to  men.  Now  it  behooves  us  to 
expiate  it.  I  gave  you  a  mirror  and  a  golden  mask; 
here  is  my  third  present,  which  will  be  the  last." 

In  the  bard's  right  hand  he  placed  a  dagger. 

Of  the  poet,  we  know  that  he  killed  himself 
upon  leaving  the  palace;  of  the  king,  that  he  is  a 
beggar  wandering  the  length  and  breadth  of  Ire- 
land— which  was  once  his  kingdom — and  that  he 
has  never  repeated  the  poem.

Undr 


The  reader  should  be  forewarned  that  the  follow- 
ing pages  will  not  be  found  in  the  Libellus  (1615)  of 
Adam  of  Bremen,  who,  as  everyone  knows,  was 
born  and  died  in  the  eleventh  century.  They  were 
unearthed  by  Lappenberg  in  a  manuscript  in  the 
Bodleian,  at  Oxford,  and,  given  the  wealth  of  cir- 
cumstantial details,  he  judged  them  a  late  in- 
terpolation, but  he  published  them  as  a  curiosity  in 
his  Analecta  Germanica  (Leipzig,  1894).  The  opin- 
ion of  a  mere  Argentine  amateur  is  of  little  ac- 
count; let  the  reader  judge  these  pages  for  him- 
self. My  translation  is  faithful,  but  it  is  not  literal. 
Adam  of  Bremen  wrote: 

.  .  .  Of  the  peoples  who  live  on  the  edge  of  the 
wilderness  that  stretches  away  on  the  other  shore 
of  the  Barbarian  Gulf,  beyond  the  lands  where  the 
wild  horse  breeds,  the  worthiest  of  mention  are 
the  Urns.  The  uncertain  or  invented  information 
of  traders,  the  dangers  of  the  route,  and  the  plun- 
dering of  nomads  prevented  me  from  reaching 
their  territory.  It  is  clear,  however,  that  their  rudi- 

81 


mentary,  unfrequented  villages  are  located  in  the 
lowlands  of  the  Vistula.  Unlike  the  Swedes,  the 
Urns  profess  the  true  faith  of  Christ,  untainted  by 
Arianism  or  by  the  bloodthirsty  worship  of  devils, 
from  which  the  royal  houses  of  England  and  other 
northern  nations  trace  their  lineages.  The  Urns 
are  herdsmen,  ferrymen,  shamans,  forgers  of 
swords,  and  harness  makers.  Owing  to  the  rigors 
of  war,  they  barely  till  the  soil.  One  invariably 
comes  to  resemble  one's  enemies,  and  the  steppe 
and  the  tribes  that  roam  it  have  made  the  Urns 
very  skilled  in  the  handling  of  horse  and  bow. 
Their  spears,  since  they  are  used  by  horsemen  and 
not  foot  soldiers,  are  longer  than  ours. 

As  may  be  imagined,  the  Urns  are  unfamiliar 
with  pen,  inkhorn,  and  parchment.  They  carve 
their  characters  as  our  ancestors  carved  the  runes 
which  Odin  revealed  to  them  after  having  hung 
from  the  ash  tree — Odin  given  to  Odin — through 
nine  days  and  nights. 

To  this  general  information  I  add  an  account  of 
what  I  was  told  by  a  traveler  from  Iceland,  Ulf 
Sigurdsson,  a  man  of  grave  and  measured  words. 
We  met  in  Uppsala,  near  the  temple.  The  wood 
fire  had  died,  and  the  cold  and  the  dawn  entered 
through  the  uneven  chinks  in  the  wall.  Outside, 
the  gray  wolves,  which  eat  the  flesh  of  the  hea- 
thens sacrificed  to  the  three  gods,  left  their  wary 
tracks  in  the  snow.  Our  conversation  began  in 
Latin,  as  is  usual  with  churchmen,  but  we  were  not 
long  in  slipping  into  the  tongue  of  the  north, 
which  extends  from  Thule  all  the  way  to  the  mar- 
ketplaces of  Asia.  The  man  said: 

As  I  am  of  the  race  of  the  skalds,  to  learn  that 
the  poetry  of  the  Urns  consists  of  a  single  word 

82 


was  enough  for  me  to  set  out  in  search  of  them 
and  the  way  that  would  lead  to  their  land.  Not 
without  exhaustion  and  hardship  did  I  arrive 
there  after  a  year-long  journey.  It  was  night,  and 
all  those  I  came  upon  shot  me  odd  looks,  and  one 
or  two  stones  were  hurled  at  me. 

Seeing  the  light  of  a  blacksmith's  forge,  I  ap- 
proached it.  The  smith,  whose  name  was  Orm,  of- 
fered me  lodging  for  the  night.  His  language  was 
more  or  less  ours.  We  exchanged  a  few  words. 
From  his  lips  I  heard  for  the  first  time  the  name  of 
the  reigning  king- — Gunnlaug.  I  learned  that  after 
his  last  war  he  looked  with  suspicion  upon 
strangers  and  that  it  was  his  custom  to  crucify 
them.  To  avoid  that  fate,  which  is  less  fitting  to  a 
man  than  a  god,  I  undertook  the  composition  of  a 
drdpa,  or  ode,  that  celebrated  the  victories,  the 
fame,  and  the  mercy  of  the  king.  I  had  barely 
committed  it  to  memory  when  two  men  came 
searching  for  me.  I  did  not  want  to  surrender  my 
sword  to  them,  but  I  let  myself  be  led  away. 

There  were  still  stars  in  the  sky.  We  crossed  the 
first  of  several  stretches  of  open  ground  with  huts 
on  every  side.  I  had  been  led  to  expect  pyramids, 
but  what  I  saw  in  the  middle  of  this  square  was  a 
yellow  wooden  post.  At  the  top  of  it  I  made  out 
the  black  figure  of  a  fish.  Orm,  who  had  accom- 
panied us,  said  that  the  fish  was  the  Word.  In  the 
next  opening,  I  saw  a  red  post  marked  with  a  disk. 
Orm  said  that  this  was  the  Word.  I  asked  him  to 
tell  me  it.  He  was  a  simple  artisan,  he  said,  and  he 
did  not  know.  In  the  third  opening,  which  was  the 
last,  I  saw  a  post  painted  black,  with  a  design  on  it 
that  I  have  forgotten.  On  the  far  side  of  the 
square  was  a  long,  straight  wall  whose  ends  I  could 

83 


not  catch  sight  of.  Later  I  found  out  that  it  was 
circular,  that  it  supported  a  mud  roof,  that  it  en- 
closed a  single  chamber,  and  that  it  stretched 
around  the  whole  city. 

The  horses  tied  to  the  hitching  post  outside 
were  of  small  stature  and  had  long  manes.  The 
blacksmith  was  not  allowed  entrance.  Inside  there 
were  armed  men,  all  standing.  Gunnlaug,  the 
king,  who  was  ailing,  lay  with  his  eyes  half  shut 
on  some  camel  hides  on  a  kind  of  dais.  He  was  a 
wasted,  yellowish  man,  a  sacred  and  almost  forgot- 
ten thing;  old  scars  spanned  the  width  of  his  chest. 
One  of  the  soldiers  opened  a  way  for  me.  Some- 
one had  brought  a  harp.  Kneeling,  I  intoned  the 
drdpa  in  a  low  voice.  There  was  no  lack  of  the  rhe- 
torical figures,  the  alliterations,  and  the  stresses 
that  the  form  demands.  I  do  not  know  whether 
the  king  understood  it,  but  he  gave  me  a  silver 
ring,  which  I  still  preserve.  Under  his  pillow,  I 
glimpsed  the  edge  of  a  dagger.  To  his  right  was  a 
chessboard  with  a  hundred  squares  and  a  handful 
of  scattered  pieces. 

The  guard  shoved  me  to  the  rear.  A  man  took 
my  place  before  the  king  but  did  not  kneel.  He 
plucked  the  harp  as  if  tuning  it,  and  in  a  low  voice 
he  uttered  the  word  that  I  had  come  in  search  of 
and  had  not  yet  fathomed. 

"It  no  longer  means  anything  now,"  someone 
said  reverently. 

I  saw  tears.  The  man  raised  or  modulated  his 
voice,  and  his  scarcely  varying  chords  were  monot- 
onous or,  still  better,  infinite.  I  would  have  liked 
his  song  to  go  on  forever  and  to  be  my  life. 
Abruptly,  it  stopped.  I  heard  the  noise  the  harp 
made  when  the  singer,  no  doubt  in  utter  exhaus- 


84 


tion,  threw  it  down.  We  all  went  out  in  disorder.  I 
was  one  of  the  last.  In  astonishment  I  saw  that  the 
light  was  waning  on  another  day.  I  walked  a  few 
steps,  when  a  hand  on  my  shoulder  made  me 
pause. 

"The  king's  ring  was  your  talisman,"  I  was  told, 
"but  you  will  not  be  long  in  meeting  your  death, 
because  you  have  heard  the  Word.  I,  Bjarni  Thor- 
kelsson,  will  save  you.  I  am  of  the  race  of  the 
skalds.  In  your  ode  you  called  blood  the  sword's 
water  and  a  battle  the  web  of  men.  I  remember 
having  heard  those  figures  from  my  father's  fa- 
ther. You  and  I  are  poets,  and  I  will  save  you. 
Nowadays,  we  do  not  define  each  thing  that  our 
song  quickens;  we  express  it  in  a  single  word, 
which  is  the  Word." 

"I  was  unable  to  hear  it,"  I  said.  "I  beg  you  to 
tell  me  what  it  is." 

He  paused  for  a  moment  or  two  and  replied,  "I 
have  sworn  not  to  divulge  it.  Besides,  nobody  can 
teach  anything.  You  must  find  it  out  for  yourself. 
But  let's  hurry;  your  life  is  in  danger.  I'll  hide  you 
in  my  house,  where  no  one  will  dare  look  for  you. 
If  the  wind  is  favorable,  tomorrow  you  will  sail 
southward  on  the  river." 

So  began  the  adventure  that  was  to  last  so  many 
winters.  I  shall  not  go  into  all  that  befell  me,  nor 
shall  I  try  to  give  an  orderly  account  of  my  shifting 
fortunes.  I  was  an  oarsman,  slave  dealer,  slave, 
woodcutter,  highwayman,  singer,  and  taster  of 
deep  waters  and  metals.  I  suffered  captivity,  and 
spent  a  year  in  the  quicksilver  mines,  which  loosen 
one's  teeth.  I  fought  side  by  side  with  men  of  Swe- 
den in  the  Varangian  guard  at  MikligarSr  [Con- 
stantinople]. On  the  shores  of  the  Sea  of  Azov  I 


85 


was  loved  by  a  woman  whom  I  shall  never  forget; 
I  left  her  or  she  left  me — it  amounts  to  the  same 
thing.  I  betrayed  and  I  was  betrayed.  More  than 
once  fate  made  me  kill.  A  Greek  soldier  chal- 
lenged me  and  gave  me  the  choice  between  two 
swords.  One  was  a  hand's  breadth  longer  than  the 
other.  Knowing  he  was  out  to  intimidate  me,  I 
chose  the  shorter.  He  asked  me  why.  I  replied  that 
with  either  the  distance  from  my  hand  to  his  heart 
was  the  same.  At  the  edge  of  the  Black  Sea  stands 
the  runic  epitaph  I  carved  for  my  comrade  in 
arms,  Leif  Arnarson.  I  have  fought  the  Blue  Men 
of  Serkland,  the  Saracens.  In  the  course  of  time  I 
have  been  many  men;  it  was  a  whirlwind,  a  long 
dream,  but  all  the  while  the  main  thing  was  the 
Word.  From  time  to  time  I  disbelieved  in  it.  I  kept 
telling  myself  that  to  renounce  the  beautiful  game 
of  combining  beautiful  words  was  senseless,  and 
that  there  was  no  reason  to  search  for  a  single,  and 
perhaps  imaginary,  word.  Such  reasoning  was 
vain.  A  missionary  suggested  the  word  "God," 
which  I  rejected.  One  early  dawn,  along  the  banks 
of  a  river  that  widened  into  a  sea,  I  believed  I  had 
come  upon  the  revelation. 

Returning  to  the  land  of  the  Urns,  I  had  some 
trouble  finding  the  singer's  house.  When  I  did,  I 
entered  and  spoke  my  name.  By  that  time,  night 
had  fallen.  From  the  floor,  Thorkelsson  told  me  to 
light  a  candle  in  the  bronze  candlestick.  His  face 
had  aged  so  much  that  I  could  not  help  thinking 
that  I,  too,  was  old.  As  is  the  custom,  I  asked  about 
his  king. 

"The  king  is  no  longer  called  Gunnlaug,"  he 
said.  "His  name  is  now  another.  Tell  me  all  about 
your  travels." 

86 


I  did  so  in  exact  order  and  with  a  great  many 
details  that  I  shall  omit  here.  Before  I  had  fin- 
ished, he  asked  me,  "Did  you  often  sing  in  those 
lands?" 

The  question  took  me  by  surprise.  "At  first,  I 
sang  to  earn  my  living,"  I  said.  "Later,  overcome 
by  a  fear  I  do  not  understand,  I  was  estranged 
from  my  harp  and  my  song." 

"All  right,"  he  said.  "You  may  go  on  with  your 
story  now." 

I  obeyed.  After  I  had  finished,  a  long  silence  fol- 
lowed. 

"The  first  woman  you  had — what  did  she  give 
you?"  he  asked. 

"Everything,"  I  said. 

"Life  gave  me  everything  as  well.  Life  gives  ev- 
erything to  everyone,  but  most  men  are  unaware 
of  it.  My  voice  is  tired  and  my  fingers  weak,  but  lis- 
ten to  me." 

He  took  up  his  harp  and  uttered  the  word 
"undr,"  which  means  "wonder."  The  dying  man's 
song  held  me  rapt,  but  in  it  and  in  his  chords  I 
recognized  my  own  verses,  the  slave  woman  who 
gave  me  my  first  love,  the  men  I  had  killed,  the 
chill  of  dawn,  daybreak  over  the  water,  the  oars.  I 
took  up  the  harp  and  sang  to  a  different  word. 

"All  right,"  the  other  man  said,  and  I  had  to 
draw  close  to  hear  him.  "You  have  understood."

Utopia  of  a  Tired  Man 


He  called  it  Utopia,  a  Greek  word  meaning  there  is 
no  such  place. 

— Qiievedo 


No  two  hills  are  alike,  but  everywhere  on  earth 
plains  are  one  and  the  same.  I  was  making  my  way 
in  such  country,  asking  myself,  not  that  it  really 
mattered,  if  this  were  Oklahoma  or  Texas  or  the 
part  of  the  Argentine  that  literary  men  called  the 
pampa.  Neither  to  right  nor  left  did  I  see  a  fence. 
As  on  other  occasions,  I  slowly  repeated  these  lines 
by  the  poet  Emilio  Oribe: 

At  the  heart  of  the  endless  awesome  plain 
and  close  by  the  border  of  Brazil, 

which  keep  growing  and  ever  expanding. 

The  road  was  uneven.  Rain  began  to  fall.  Some 
two  or  three  hundred  yards  off  I  saw  light  from  a 
house,  which  was  low  and  rectangular  and  sur- 
rounded by  trees.  The  door  was  opened  by  a  man 
so  tall  he  almost  gave  me  a  fright.  He  was  dressed 
in  gray.  I  felt  he  was  waiting  for  someone.  There 
was  no  lock  on  the  door. 

We  went  into  a  long  room  with  wooden  walls,  a 
table,  and  chairs.   A  lamp  giving  off  a  yellowish 

89 


light  hung  from  the  ceiling.  The  table,  for  some 
reason,  seemed  strange  to  me.  On  it  stood  an 
hourglass,  the  first,  outside  of  some  steel  engrav- 
ing or  other,  I  had  ever  laid  eyes  on.  The  man  mo- 
tioned me  to  one  of  the  chairs. 

I  tried  out  various  languages,  and  we  did  not 
understand  each  other.  When  at  last  he  spoke,  he 
did  so  in  Latin.  I  dusted  off  what  I  remembered 
from  my  now  distant  school  days,  readying  myself 
for  conversation. 

"By  your  clothes,  I  see  you  come  from  another 
century,"  he  said.  "A  diversity  of  tongues  favored 
a  diversity  of  peoples  and  even  of  wars.  The  world 
has  fallen  back  on  Latin.  There  are  those  who  fear 
it  may  degenerate  again  into  French,  Lemosi,  or 
Papiamento,  but  that  is  not  an  immediate  risk.  Be 
that  as  it  may,  neither  the  past  nor  the  future  in- 
terests me." 

I  said  nothing,  and  he  added,  "If  you  don't 
mind  watching  somebody  else  eat,  will  you  join 
me?" 

Seeing  that  he  noticed  my  uneasiness,  I  said  yes. 
We  went  down  a  corridor,  with  doors  on  either 
hand,  that  led  to  a  small  kitchen  in  which  every- 
thing was  made  of  metal.  We  came  back  with  our 
dinner  on  a  tray — bowls  of  cornflakes,  a  bunch  of 
grapes,  an  unfamiliar  fruit  whose  taste  reminded 
me  of  figs,  and  a  big  pitcher  of  water.  If  I  re- 
member correctly,  there  was  no  bread.  My  host's 
features  were  sharp,  and  there  was  something  un- 
usual about  his  eyes.  I  won't  forget  his  pale,  aus- 
tere face,  which  I  shall  never  see  again.  He  made 
no  gestures  when  he  spoke.  Having  to  converse  in 
Latin  inhibited  me,  but  at  last  I  said,  "Doesn't  my 
sudden  appearance  amaze  you?" 


9° 


"No,"  he  said.  "We  receive  such  visits  from  cen- 
tury to  century.  They  don't  last  long.  Tomorrow, 
at  the  latest,  you'll  be  home  again." 

The  certainty  in  his  voice  was  reassuring.  I 
thought  it  proper  to  introduce  myself.  "I  am  Eu- 
doro  Acevedo.  I  was  born  in  1897,  in  the  city  of 
Buenos  Aires.  I  am  seventy  years  old.  I  am  a  pro- 
fessor of  English  and  American  literatures  and  a 
writer  of  imaginative  tales." 

"I  remember  having  read,  not  without  pleasure, 
two  tales  of  an  imaginative  nature,"  he  said. 
"Travels  of  a  Captain  Lemuel  Gulliver,  which 
many  people  take  to  be  true,  and  the  Summa  Theo- 
logiae.  But  let's  not  speak  of  facts.  Facts  matter  to 
no  one  anymore.  They  are  mere  points  of  depar- 
ture for  invention  and  reasoning.  In  our  schools 
we  are  taught  doubt  and  the  art  of  forgetting — 
above  all,  the  forgetting  of  what  is  personal  and 
local.  We  live  in  time,  which  is  successive,  but  we 
try  to  live  sub  specie  aeternitatis.  Of  the  past  we 
retain  a  few  names,  which  language  tends  to  lose. 
We  shun  pointless  details.  We  have  neither  dates 
nor  history.  Nor  have  we  statistics.  You  said  your 
name  is  Eudoro.  I  can't  tell  you  my  name,  because 
I'm  simply  called  Someone." 

"And  what  was  your  father's  name?" 

"He  had  none." 

On  one  of  the  walls  I  saw  a  shelf.  I  opened  a 
book  at  random;  the  letters  were  clean  and  un- 
decipherable, and  they  were  written  by  hand. 
Their  angular  lines  reminded  me  of  the  runic  al- 
phabet, which,  however,  was  only  used  for  writing 
inscriptions.  I  reflected  that  these  men  of  the  fu- 
ture were  not  only  taller  but  were  more  skilled.  In- 
stinctively, I  looked  at  the  man's  long,  fine  fingers. 


91 


"Now  you  are  going  to  see  something  you've 
never  seen,"  he  said.  He  handed  me  a  copy  of 
Thomas  More's  Utopia,  printed  in  Basel  in  the  year 
1518;  leaves  and  pages  were  missing. 

Somewhat  foolishly,  I  answered,  "It's  a  printed 
book.  At  home,  I  had  over  two  thousand  of  them, 
though  they  were  neither  as  old  nor  as  valuable  as 
this  one."  I  read  the  title  aloud. 

The  man  laughed.  "No  one  can  read  two  thou- 
sand books.  In  the  four  centuries  I  have  lived,  I 
haven't  read  more  than  half  a  dozen.  Besides, 
rereading,  not  reading,  is  what  counts.  Printing — 
which  is  now  abolished,  since  it  tended  to  multiply 
unnecessary  texts  to  the  point  of  dizziness — was 
one  of  man's  worst  evils." 

"In  my  strange  past,"  I  said,  "the  superstition 
prevailed  that  every  day,  between  evening  and 
morning,  certain  acts  occur  which  it  is  a  shame  to 
be  ignorant  of.  The  planet  was  populated  by  col- 
lective ghosts — Canada,  Brazil,  the  Swiss  Congo, 
and  the  Common  Market.  Almost  no  one  knew 
anything  of  the  history  that  preceded  those  pla- 
tonic  entities,  but,  of  course,  they  knew  every  last 
detail  of  the  most  recent  congress  of  pedagogues, 
or  of  imminent  breakdowns  in  diplomatic  rela- 
tions, or  of  statements  issued  by  presidents,  drawn 
up  by  the  secretary  of  a  secretary  and  containing 
all  the  carefully  worded  haziness  appropriate  to 
the  genre.  These  things  were  read  to  be  forgotten, 
for,  only  hours  later,  other  trivialities  would  blot 
them  out.  Of  all  offices,  that  of  politician  was  with- 
out doubt  the  most  public.  An  ambassador  or  a 
Cabinet  minister  was  a  kind  of  cripple  whom  it  was 
necessary  to  cart  around  in  long,  noisy  vehicles, 
ringed  by  motorcyclists  and  military  escorts  and 


92 


awaited  by  eager  photographers.  It  seems  that 
their  feet  have  been  cut  off,  my  mother  used  to 
say.  Pictures  and  the  printed  word  were  more  real 
than  the  things  they  stood  for.  Only  what  was  pub- 
lished had  any  reality.  Esse  est  percipi  (to  be  is  to  be 
photographed)  was  the  beginning,  middle,  and 
end  of  our  singular  idea  of  the  world.  In  that  past 
of  mine,  people  were  naive;  they  believed  that  cer- 
tain merchandise  was  good  because  its  own  makers 
claimed  so  over  and  over  again.  Robberies  were 
also  frequent,  though  everyone  knew  that  the  pos- 
session of  money  brings  no  greater  happiness  or 
peace  of  mind." 

"Money?"  the  man  echoed.  "No  one  any  longer 
suffers  poverty,  which  must  have  been  unbearable, 
or  wealth,  which  must  have  been  the  most  uncom- 
fortable form  of  vulgarity.  Everyone  has  a  calling." 

"Like  the  rabbis,"  I  said. 

He  appeared  not  to  understand  and  went  on. 
"Nor  are  there  cities  anymore.  To  judge  by  the 
ruins  of  Bahia  Blanca,  which  I  once  explored,  not 
much  has  been  lost.  There  are  no  personal  posses- 
sions now,  there  are  no  inheritances.  At  the  age  of 
a  hundred,  when  a  man  matures,  he  is  ready  to 
come  face  to  face  with  himself  and  his  loneliness. 
By  then  he  will  have  fathered  a  child." 

"One  child?"  I  asked. 

"Yes.  Only  one.  There  is  no  reason  to  carry  on 
the  human  race.  Some  people  think  man  is  an 
organ  of  the  godhead  for  universal  consciousness, 
but  nobody  knows  for  sure  whether  such  a  god- 
head exists.  The  advantages  and  disadvantages  of 
gradual  or  simultaneous  suicide  by  every  man  and 
woman  on  earth  are,  I  believe,  now  being  argued. 
But  let's  get  back  to  what  we  were  saying." 


93 


I  agreed. 

"Having  reached  a  hundred,  the  individual  no 
longer  stands  in  need  of  love  or  friendship.  Evils 
and  involuntary  death  are  no  threat  to  him.  He 
practices  one  of  the  arts  or  philosophy  or  mathe- 
matics or  he  plays  a  game  of  solitary  chess.  When 
he  wants  to,  he  kills  himself.  Man  is  master  of  his 
life.  He  is  also  master  of  his  death." 

"Is  that  a  quotation?"  I  asked. 

"Of  course.  Quotations  are  all  we  have  now. 
Language  is  a  system  of  quotations." 

"And  the  great  adventure  of  my  time — space 
travel?"  I  asked. 

"It's  centuries  ago  now  that  those  travels  were 
given  up.  They  were  certainly  to  be  admired,  but 
we  could  never  rid  ourselves  of  a  here  and  now." 
With  a  smile,  he  added,  "Besides,  all  travel  is  spa- 
tial. To  go  from  one  planet  to  another  is  like  going 
to  the  farm  across  the  way.  When  you  entered  this 
room,  you  were  carrying  out  a  voyage  through 
space." 

"That's  right,"  I  said.  "And  one  also  used  to 
speak  of  chemical  substances  and  animals." 

The  man  now  turned  his  back  to  me  and  looked 
outside.  Beyond  the  windows,  the  plain  was  white 
with  silent  snow  and  moonlight. 

I  got  up  my  courage  to  ask,  "Are  there  still  mu- 
seums and  libraries?" 

"No.  We  try  to  forget  the  past,  except  for  the 
writing  of  elegies.  There  are  no  commemorations 
or  anniversaries  or  effigies  of  dead  men  now.  Each 
of  us  must  himself  produce  the  arts  and  sciences 
he  needs." 

"Then  everyone  must  be  his  own  Bernard  Shaw, 
his  own  Jesus  Christ,  his  own  Archimedes." 


94 


He  agreed  without  a  word. 

"What  happened  to  governments?" 

"According  to  tradition,  they  fell  into  gradual 
disuse,"  he  said.  "They  called  elections,  declared 
wars,  collected  taxes,  confiscated  fortunes,  ordered 
arrests,  and  tried  to  impose  censorship,  but  no- 
body on  earth  obeyed  them.  The  press  stopped 
publishing  the  news  and  photographs  of  govern- 
ment leaders.  Politicians  had  to  find  honest  work; 
some  of  them  made  good  comedians  or  good  faith 
healers.  What  actually  happened  was  probably  far 
more  complex  than  this  summary."  He  went  on  in 
a  changed  tone.  "I  built  this  house,  which  is  the 
same  as  all  others.  I  carved  this  furniture  and 
these  utensils.  I  worked  these  fields,  which  will  be 
improved  by  people  unknown  to  me.  May  I  show 
you  a  few  things?" 

I  followed  him  into  an  adjoining  room.  He  lit  a 
lamp  like  the  first  one;  it,  too,  hung  from  the  ceil- 
ing. In  a  corner  I  saw  a  harp  with  few  strings.  On 
the  walls  were  rectangular  canvases  in  which  yel- 
low tones  predominated.  The  work  did  not  seem 
that  of  the  same  hand. 

"This  is  what  I  do,"  he  said. 

I  examined  the  canvases,  stopping  before  the 
smallest  one,  which  represented,  or  suggested,  a 
sunset  and  which  encompassed  something  infinite. 

"If  you  like  it,  you  can  have  it  as  a  keepsake  of  a 
future  friend,"  he  said  matter-of-factly. 

I  thanked  him,  but  there  were  a  few  canvases 
that  left  me  uneasy.  I  won't  say  that  they  were 
blank,  but  they  were  nearly  so. 

"They're  painted  in  colors  that  your  eyes  of  the 
past  can't  see,"  he  said. 

A    moment    later,    when    his    delicate    hands 


95 


plucked  the  strings  of  the  harp,  I  barely  caught  an 
occasional  sound.  Just  then  a  knock  was  heard. 

A  tall  woman  and  three  or  four  men  entered  the 
house.  One  would  have  said  that  they  were 
brothers  and  sisters  or  that  time  had  made  them 
alike.  My  host  spoke  to  the  woman  first. 

"I  knew  you  wouldn't  fail  to  come  tonight.  Have 
you  seen  Nils?" 

"Off  and  on.  He's  as  devoted  to  his  painting  as 
ever." 

"Let's  hope  with  more  success  than  his  father." 

The  dismantling  began.  Manuscripts,  pictures, 
furnishings,  utensils — we  left  nothing  in  the 
house.  The  woman  worked  alongside  the  men.  I 
was  ashamed  of  my  weakness,  which  scarcely  al- 
lowed me  to  be  of  any  help.  No  one  shut  the  door 
and  we  went  out,  loaded  with  things.  I  noticed  that 
the  house  had  a  saddle  roof. 

After  a  fifteen-minute  walk,  we  turned  left.  In 
the  distance  I  made  out  a  kind  of  tower,  crowned 
with  a  cupola. 

"It's  the  crematory,"  someone  said.  "Inside  it  is 
the  lethal  chamber.  It's  said  to  have  been  invented 
by  a  philanthropist  whose  name,  I  think,  was 
Adolf  Hitler." 

The  caretaker,  whose  stature  by  now  did  not  as- 
tonish me,  opened  the  gate  to  us.  My  host  ex- 
changed a  few  words  with  him.  Before  stepping 
into  the  enclosure,  he  waved  goodbye. 

"It  looks  like  more  snow,"  the  woman  said. 

In  my  study  on  Mexico  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires, 
I  have  the  canvas  that  someone  will  paint,  thou- 
sands of  years  from  now,  with  substances  today 
scattered  over  the  whole  planet.

The  Bribe 


My  story  is  about  two  men  or,  rather,  about  an  ep- 
isode involving  two  men.  The  actual  affair,  in  itself 
neither  singular  nor  even  out  of  the  ordinary, 
matters  less  than  the  character  of  its  protagonists. 
Each  of  them  sinned  out  of  vanity,  but  in  different 
ways  and  with  different  results.  The  events  giving 
rise  to  the  anecdote  (for  really  it  is  not  much 
more)  took  place  a  short  time  ago.  To  my  mind,  it 
could  only  have  happened  where  it  did — in 
America. 

I  had  occasion  at  the  University  of  Texas,  in 
Austin,  to  speak  at  length  to  one  of  the  two,  Dr. 
Ezra  Winthrop.  This  was  toward  the  end  of  1961. 
Winthrop  was  a  professor  of  Old  English  (he  did 
not  approve  of  the  term  "Anglo-Saxon,"  which  to 
him  suggested  an  artifact  made  of  two  parts).  I  can 
remember  that  without  once  contradicting  me  he 
corrected  my  many  mistakes  and  rash  assumptions 
about  the  language.  I  was  told  that  in  his  examina- 
tions he  never  asked  a  single  question  but  invited 
his  students  to  expatiate  upon  this  or  that  topic, 
leaving  the  choice   up  to  them.   Of  old   Puritan 


97 


stock,  a  native  of  Boston,  Winthrop  had  found  it 
hard  getting  used  to  the  habits  and  prejudices  of 
the  South.  He  missed  the  snow,  but  it  is  my  obser- 
vation that  Northerners  are  conditioned  to  the 
cold,  much  as  we  Argentines  are  to  the  heat.  I  still 
preserve  the  image,  now  dim,  of  a  rather  tall  man 
with  gray  hair,  less  agile  than  strong.  Clearer  is  my 
memory  of  his  colleague,  Herbert  Locke,  who 
gave  me  a  copy  of  his  book  Toward  a  History  of  the 
Kenning,  in  which  one  reads  that  the  Saxons  were 
not  long  in  dispensing  with  those  somewhat  too 
mechanical  metaphors  ("whale's  road"  for  "the 
sea,"  "falcon  of  battle"  for  "the  eagle"),  whereas 
the  skalds  went  on  combining  and  interweaving 
them  to  the  point  of  inextricability.  I  mention 
Herbert  Locke  because  he  is  an  integral  part  of  my 
story. 

I  now  come  to  the  Icelander,  Eric  Einarsson, 
who  is  perhaps  the  true  protagonist.  I  never  set 
eyes  on  him.  He  arrived  in  Texas  in  1969,  when  I 
was  in  Cambridge,  but  the  letters  of  a  mutual 
friend,  Ramon  Martinez  Lopez,  have  left  me  feel- 
ing I  know  Einarsson  intimately.  I  know  that  he 
was  impetuous,  energetic,  and  cold,  and  that  in  a 
land  of  tall  men  he  was  tall.  Given  his  red  hair,  it 
was  inevitable  that  his  students  dub  him  Eric  the 
Red.  In  his  opinion,  the  use  of  slang  by  a  for- 
eigner was  forced  and  mistaken,  making  him  an 
intruder,  so  he  never  condescended  even  to  an  oc- 
casional "okay."  A  serious  scholar  of  the  Nordic 
languages,  of  English,  of  Latin,  and — although  he 
would  not  admit  it — of  German,  he  found  no  dif- 
ficulty in  making  his  way  in  American  universities. 

Einarsson's  first  work  of  any  consequence  was  a 
study  of  the  four  articles  that  De  Quincey  wrote 

98 


on  the  Danish  origins  of  Cumbrian  dialect.  This 
was  followed  by  a  study  of  one  of  the  rural  dialects 
of  Yorkshire.  Both  publications  were  well  re- 
ceived, but  Einarsson  felt  his  career  needed  a 
boost.  In  1970,  the  Yale  University  Press  pub- 
lished his  lengthy  critical  edition  of  the  Battle  of 
Maldon.  The  scholarship  of  Einarsson's  notes  was 
undeniable;  in  the  introduction,  however,  certain 
of  his  hypotheses  stirred  up  controversy  in  the  al- 
most secret  circles  of  academics.  There  he  stated, 
for  example,  that  in  style  the  poem  has  an  af- 
finity— even  if  a  remote  one — with  the  heroic 
Finnsburh  fragment  and  not  with  the  deliberate 
rhetoric  of  Beowulf,  and  that  its  handling  of  mov- 
ing circumstantial  details  strangely  foreshadows 
the  methods  which,  not  unjustly,  we  admire  in  the 
Icelandic  sagas.  He  also  emended  a  number  of 
readings  in  Elphinston's  text.  Einarsson  was  made 
full  professor  at  Texas  the  same  year  he  arrived. 

As  everyone  knows,  scholarly  conferences  are 
popular  in  American  universities.  Dr.  Winthrop, 
in  his  turn,  had  given  a  paper  at  one  of  the  impor- 
tant Germanic  symposia  the  year  before,  at 
Michigan  State.  His  department  head,  who  was 
getting  ready  to  go  off  on  sabbatical,  asked 
Winthrop  to  choose  a  delegate  to  deliver  a  paper 
at  the  next  conference,  to  be  held  at  Wisconsin. 
There  were  only  two  real  candidates — Herbert 
Locke  and  Eric  Einarsson. 

Winthrop,  like  Carlyle,  had  renounced  the  Puri- 
tan faith  of  his  ancestors  but  not  its  ethics.  His 
duty  was  clear,  and  he  did  not  decline  to  give  his 
advice.  Herbert  Locke,  going  back  to  1954,  had 
been  unstinting  in  his  assistance  to  him,  particu- 
larly with  regard  to  a  certain  annotated  edition  of 


99 


Beowulf  which,  in  a  number  of  universities,  had 
replaced  Klaeber's  edition.  Locke  was  now  com- 
piling a  very  useful  work  for  the  Germanic  special- 
ist— an  English-Anglo-Saxon  dictionary  that 
would  save  readers  from  the  often  useless  exami- 
nation of  etymological  dictionaries.  The  Icelander 
was  considerably  younger;  his  insolence  had 
earned  him  everyone's  dislike,  including 
Winthrop's.  Einarsson's  critical  edition  of  Maldon 
had  contributed  a  good  deal  to  spreading  his 
name.  He  was  a  master  of  polemic,  and  at  the  sym- 
posium he  would  cut  a  better  figure  than  the  shy, 
taciturn  Locke. 

Winthrop  was  in  the  midst  of  these  consider- 
ations when  there  appeared  in  the  review  columns 
of  the  Yale  Philological  Quarterly  a  long  article  on 
the  teaching  of  Anglo-Saxon.  The  piece  was 
signed  with  the  giveaway  initials  "E.  E."  and,  as  if 
to  allay  any  doubt,  under  them  it  read  "University 
of  Texas."  Written  in  a  foreigner's  correct  English, 
the  article,  while  not  admitting  of  the  least  in- 
civility, embodied  a  certain  violence.  It  argued  that 
to  begin  Anglo-Saxon  by  studying  Beowulf,  the 
work  of  an  early  period  but  in  a  pseudo-Virgilian, 
rhetorical  style,  was  as  arbitrary  as  to  begin  the 
study  of  English  with  the  elaborate  poetry  of  Mil- 
ton. Its  author  advised  an  inversion  of  chronolog- 
ical order,  starting,  say,  with  the  eleventh-century 
poem  "The  Grave,"  in  which  the  everyday  lan- 
guage comes  through,  and  then  going  back  to  the 
origins.  As  for  Beowulf,  some  excerpt  from  its  te- 
dious aggregate  of  over  three  thousand  lines  was 
enough — for  example,  the  funeral  rites  of  Scyld, 
who  came  from  the  sea  and  returns  to  the  sea. 
There  was  no  mention  of  Winthrop's  name  in  the 


100 


article,  but  nonetheless  he  felt  himself  stiffly  at- 
tacked. This  mattered  less  to  him,  however,  than 
the  fact  that  his  teaching  method  had  been  im- 
pugned. 

Only  a  few  days  were  left.  Wanting  to  be  fair, 
Winthrop  could  not  allow  Einarsson's  article,  which 
was  being  widely  commented  upon,  to  influence 
his  decision.  The  choice  between  Locke  and  the 
Icelander  gave  him  no  small  trouble.  Winthrop 
spoke  to  Lee  Rosenthal,  the  department  chairman, 
one  morning,  and  that  same  afternoon  Einarsson 
was  officially  named  to  make  the  trip  to  Wisconsin. 

On  the  eve  of  his  departure,  Einarsson  pre- 
sented himself  in  Ezra  Winthrop's  office.  He  had 
come  to  say  goodbye  and  to  thank  Winthrop. 
One  of  the  windows  opened  onto  a  tree-lined  side 
street,  and  the  two  men  were  surrounded  by 
shelves  of  books.  Einarsson  was  quick  to  recognize 
a  first  edition  of  the  Edda  Islandorum,  bound  in 
parchment.  Winthrop  told  him  that  he  was  sure 
Einarsson  would  do  a  good  job  and  that  he  had 
nothing  to  thank  him  for.  Their  conversation,  if  I 
am  not  mistaken,  was  long. 

"Let's  speak  frankly,"  said  Einarsson.  "Everyone 
knows  that  in  honoring  me  with  representing  the 
university,  Rosenthal  is  acting  upon  your  advice.  I 
am  a  good  Germanic  scholar;  I'll  do  my  best  not  to 
disappoint  him.  The  tongue  of  my  childhood  is 
the  tongue  of  the  sagas,  and  I  pronounce  Anglo- 
Saxon  better  than  my  British  colleagues.  My  stu- 
dents say  'cyning,'  not  'cunning.'  They  also  know 
that  smoking  is  absolutely  forbidden  in  my  classes 
and  that  they  cannot  come  to  them  rigged  out  as 
hippies.  As  regards  my  unsuccessful  rival,  it  would 
be  in  very  bad  taste  were  I  to  criticize  him.  In  his 


101 


book  on  the  kenning  he  demonstrates  not  only  his 
research  into  original  sources  but  also  into  the  per- 
tinent works  of  Meissner  and  Marquardt.  But  let's 
put  all  this  nonsense  aside.  I  owe  you  a  personal 
explanation." 

Einarsson  paused,  gave  a  glance  out  the  win- 
dow, and  resumed.  "I  left  my  country  at  the  end 
of  1964,"  he  said.  "When  someone  decides  to  emi- 
grate to  a  distant  land,  he  fatally  imposes  upon 
himself  the  duty  of  getting  on  in  that  land.  My 
first  two  small  works,  whose  nature  was  strictly 
philological,  had  no  other  object  than  to  demon- 
strate my  ability.  That,  obviously,  was  not  enough. 
I  had  always  been  interested  in  the  Battle  of  Mal- 
don,  which  I  can  repeat  from  memory — with  an 
occasional  slip  or  two.  I  managed  to  get  Yale  to 
publish  my  critical  edition  of  it.  The  poem  records 
a  Norse  victory,  as  you  know,  but  as  regards  the 
notion  that  it  may  have  influenced  the  later  Ice- 
landic sagas,  I  judge  that  inadmissible  and  absurd. 
I  hinted  at  this  merely  to  flatter  English-speaking 
readers." 

The  Icelander  held  Winthrop  in  his  gaze.  "I 
come  now  to  the  heart  of  the  matter — my  polemi- 
cal piece  in  the  Quarterly.  As  you  are  aware,  it  jus- 
tifies, or  tries  to  justify,  my  system,  but  it  deliber- 
ately exaggerates  the  drawbacks  of  yours,  which, 
in  exchange  for  imposing  on  the  student  the  bore- 
dom of  three  thousand  consecutive  lines  of  in- 
tricate verse  that  narrate  a  confused  story,  endows 
him  with  a  large  vocabulary,  allowing  him  to 
enjoy — if  by  then  he  has  not  given  it  up — the  en- 
tire corpus  of  Anglo-Saxon  literature.  To  go  to 
Wisconsin  was  my  real  aim.  You  and  I,  my  dear 
friend,   know   that  these  conferences  are   foolish 


102 


and  that  they  entail  pointless  expense  but  that  they 
can  prove  useful  in  one's  career." 

Winthrop  looked  at  him  in  surprise.  The  New 
Englander  was  an  intelligent  man,  but  he  tended 
to  take  things  seriously — including  conferences 
and  the  world,  which  may  very  well  be  a  cosmic 
joke. 

"You  perhaps  remember  our  first  conversation," 
Einarsson  went  on.  "I  had  arrived  from  New 
York.  It  was  a  Sunday.  The  university  dining  halls 
were  closed,  and  we  had  lunch  at  the  Nighthawk.  I 
learned  a  great  deal  from  that  meeting.  As  a  good 
European,  I  had  always  supposed  that  the  Ameri- 
can Civil  War  was  a  crusade  against  slave  owners; 
you  argued  that  the  South  was  within  its  rights  to 
wish  to  secede  from  the  Union  and  to  maintain  its 
own  institutions.  To  lend  greater  strength  to  what 
you  were  saying,  you  told  me  that  you  were  a 
Northerner  and  that  one  of  your  forebears  had 
fought  in  that  war  in  the  ranks  of  Henry  Halleck. 
You  also  praised  the  courage  of  the  Confederates. 
I  have  an  unusual  flair  for  making  instant  assess- 
ments. That  morning  was  enough  for  me.  I  real- 
ized, my  dear  Winthrop,  that  you  are  governed  by 
the  curious  American  passion  for  impartiality.  You 
want,  above  all,  to  be  fair-minded.  Precisely  be- 
cause you  are  a  Northerner,  you  attempt  to  under- 
stand and  justify  the  South's  cause.  As  soon  as  I 
knew  that  my  trip  to  Wisconsin  depended  on  what 
you  might  say  to  Rosenthal,  I  pressed  the  Quarterly 
to  get  my  article  into  print,  knowing  that  to  criti- 
cize your  teaching  methods  was  the  best  means  of 
getting  your  vote." 

There  was  a  long  silence.  Winthrop  was  the  first 
to  break  it.  "I'm  an  old  friend  of  Herbert's,  whose 


°3 


work  I  esteem,"  he  said.  "Directly  or  indirectly, 
you  attacked  me.  To  have  denied  you  my  vote 
would  have  been  a  sort  of  reprisal.  I  assessed  his 
merits  and  yours,  and  the  result  you  already 
know."  He  added,  as  if  thinking  aloud,  "Maybe  I 
gave  in  to  the  vanity  of  not  seeking  revenge.  As 
you  see,  your  stratagem  worked." 

"Stratagem  is  the  right  word,"  Einarsson  re- 
plied, "but  I  do  not  regret  what  I  did.  I  shall 
always  act  in  the  best  interests  of  our  department. 
Be  that  as  it  may,  I  was  determined  to  go  to  Wis- 
consin." 

"My  first  Viking,"  said  Winthrop,  looking  Ein- 
arsson straight  in  the  eye. 

"Another  romantic  superstition.  It  is  not  enough 
to  be  a  Scandinavian  to  have  descended  from  Vik- 
ings. My  forefathers  were  good  pastors  of  the 
Evangelical  church;  at  the  beginning  of  the  tenth 
century,  my  ancestors  may  have  been  good  priests 
of  Thor.  In  my  family,  as  far  as  I  know,  there 
were  never  any  seafarers." 

"There  were  many  in  mine,"  Winthrop  said. 
"Still,  we  aren't  so  different.  One  sin  is  common  to 
us  both — vanity.  You  pay  me  this  visit  to  boast  of 
your  clever  stratagem;  I  backed  you  to  boast  that  I 
am  an  upright  man." 

"Another  thing  is  common  to  us,"  said  Einars- 
son. "Nationality.  I  am  an  American  citizen.  My 
destiny  is  here,  not  in  Ultima  Thule.  You  would 
say  that  a  passport  does  not  change  a  man's  na- 
ture." 

Then,  shaking  hands,  they  took  leave  of  each 
other.

Avelino  Arredondo 


The  event  took  place  in  Montevideo  in  1897. 

Every  Saturday,  in  the  way  of  the  honest  poor 
who  know  they  cannot  invite  people  home  or  else 
are  trying  to  escape  home,  a  group  of  young  men 
occupied  the  same  side  table  at  the  Cafe  del  Globo. 
They  were  all  from  Montevideo,  and  they  had  found 
it  hard  at  first  to  make  friends  with  Arredondo,  a 
man  from  the  interior,  who  neither  confided  in 
others  nor  encouraged  others  to  confide  in  him.  A 
little  over  twenty  years  old,  he  was  lean  and  dark, 
rather  short,  and  maybe  a  bit  clumsy.  His  would 
have  been  an  almost  anonymous  face  had  his 
eyes — at  one  and  the  same  time  sleepy  and  lively — 
not  rescued  it.  He  worked  as  a  clerk  in  a  drygoods 
store  on  Buenos  Aires  Street,  studying  law  in  his 
spare  time. When  the  others  condemned  the  war 
that  ravaged  the  country  and  that,  according  to 
general  opinion,  the  president  was  prolonging  for 
unworthy  reasons,  Arredondo  remained  silent.  He 
also  remained  silent  when  they  made  fun  of  him 
for  being  stingy. 

A  short  while  after  the  battle  of  Cerros  Blancos, 


IOt 


Arredondo  told  his  companions  that  they  would 
not  be  seeing  him  for  a  time,  since  he  had  to  travel 
to  Mercedes.  The  news  stirred  no  one.  Somebody 
told  him  to  watch  out  for  the  gaucho  rabble  of 
Aparicio  Saravia,  the  rebel  leader  of  the  Whites. 
With  a  smile,  Arredondo  answered  that  he  was  not 
afraid  of  the  Whites.  The  other  man,  who  was  a 
W7hite  himself,  said  nothing. 

His  goodbye  to  Clara,  his  fiancee,  Arredondo 
found  harder.  He  made  it  in  almost  the  same 
words  he  had  used  with  his  friends,  warning  her 
not  to  expect  letters,  as  he  would  be  very  busy. 
Clara,  who  was  not  in  the  habit  of  writing,  ac- 
cepted the  explanation  without  a  protest.  The  two 
were  very  much  in  love. 

Arredondo  lived  on  the  outskirts  of  town.  He 
was  looked  after  by  a  mulatto  woman  who  bore 
the  same  surname  as  he,  since  her  forebears  had 
been  slaves  of  his  family  many  years  earlier,  at  the 
time  of  the  Great  War.  Clementina  was  completely 
trustworthy,  and  he  ordered  her  to  tell  anyone 
who  came  looking  for  him  that  he  was  away  in  the 
country.  He  had  already  collected  his  last  pay 
from  the  drygoods  store. 

He  moved  into  a  back  room  of  his  house — one 
that  opened  onto  the  earth-paved  third  patio.  It 
was  a  pointless  measure,  but  it  helped  him  to  initi- 
ate his  self-imposed  reclusion.  From  the  narrow 
iron  bed,  in  which  he  was  beginning  to  take  naps 
again,  he  looked  with  a  touch  of  melancholy  at  a 
bare  shelf.  He  had  sold  his  books — even  his  text- 
books. All  he  had  left  was  a  Bible  that  he  had 
never  read  before  and  that  he  would  never  finish 
reading. 

He  leafed  through  it  page  by  page — sometimes 

106 


out  of  interest,  sometimes  out  of  boredom — and 
he  took  upon  himself  the  task  of  learning  by  heart 
some  chapter  or  other  of  Exodus  and  the  end  of 
Ecclesiastes.  He  made  no  effort  to  understand 
what  he  read.  He  was  a  freethinker,  but  he  never 
let  a  single  night  pass  without  saying  the  Lord's 
Prayer,  which,  on  coming  to  Montevideo,  he  had 
promised  his  mother  he  would  do.  To  fail  in  this 
filial  promise,  he  thought,  might  bring  him  bad 
luck. 

Arredondo  knew  that  his  goal  was  the  morning 
of  the  twenty-fifth  of  August.  He  knew  the  exact 
number  of  days  he  had  to  get  through.  Once  his 
goal  was  attained,  time  would  cease,  or,  rather, 
nothing  that  happened  after  that  would  matter. 
He  awaited  the  date  like  someone  awaiting  a  boon 
or  a  liberation.  He  had  let  his  clock  run  down  so  as 
not  to  be  forever  looking  at  it,  but  every  night,  on 
hearing  the  twelve  dark  strokes  of  midnight  on  a 
town  clock,  he  tore  a  leaf  out  of  the  calendar  and 
thought,  One  day  less. 

In  the  beginning  he  worked  to  build  up  a  rou- 
tine— brewing  mate,  smoking  Turkish  cigarettes 
that  he  rolled  himself,  reading  and  rereading  a  set 
number  of  pages,  trying  to  converse  with  Clemen- 
tina when  she  brought  him  his  meals  on  a  tray, 
and,  before  putting  out  the  candle,  repeating  and 
embellishing  the  speech  he  planned  to  give.  Talk- 
ing to  Clementina,  a  woman  well  along  in  years, 
was  not  at  all  easy,  for  her  memory  had  remained 
rooted  in  the  countryside  and  in  its  daily  life.  Ar- 
redondo also  laid  out  a  chessboard,  on  which  he 
played  haphazard  games  that  never  came  to  a  con- 
clusion. He  was  missing  a  rook,  which  he  replaced 
with  a  bullet  or  with  a  two-cent  coin. 


107 


To  fill  time,  he  cleaned  his  room  every  morning, 
chasing  away  spiders  with  a  dustcloth  and  broom. 
The  mulatto  woman  did  not  like  his  doing  these 
menial  tasks,  which  were  her  domain  and  which, 
in  addition,  he  was  not  especially  good  at.  He 
would  have  preferred  waking  with  the  sun  already 
high,  but  his  habit  of  getting  up  at  dawn  was 
stronger  than  his  will.  He  missed  his  friends  a 
good  deal  but,  without  feeling  bitter  about  it,  he 
knew  that,  given  his  invincible  reserve,  they  were 
not  missing  him.  One  evening,  one  of  them  came 
to  ask  for  him  and  was  turned  away  from  the 
door.  Clementina  did  not  know  the  caller,  and  Ar- 
redondo  never  learned  who  it  was.  He  had  been 
an  avid  reader  of  newspapers,  and  now  he  found 
it  hard  giving  up  these  museums  of  ephemeral  tid- 
bits. He  was  not  a  man  cut  out  for  deep  thinking 
or  for  deliberating. 

His  days  and  his  nights  were  all  the  same,  but 
Sundays  weighed  most  on  him.  Toward  the  mid- 
dle of  July,  he  suspected  that  it  had  been  a  mistake 
to  parcel  out  time,  which  in  some  way  bears  us 
along.  Presently,  he  let  his  imagination  wander 
over  the  length  and  breadth  of  Uruguay,  then 
running  with  blood — over  the  rolling  fields  of 
Santa  Irene,  where  he  had  flown  kites;  over  a  cer- 
tain pinto,  which  by  now  would  be  dead;  over  the 
dust  raised  by  cattle  when  they  are  herded  by 
drovers;  over  the  weary  stagecoach  that  came 
from  Fray  Bentos  once  a  month  with  its  hoard  of 
trinkets;  over  the  bay  of  La  Agraciada,  where  the 
Thirty-Three,  the  country's  national  heroes,  had 
disembarked;  over  the  Hervidero;  over  the  hill 
ranges,  the  woods,  and  the  rivers;  over  the  Cerro, 
where  he  had  climbed  up  to  the  lighthouse,  think- 


108 


ing  that  on  either  bank  of  the  Plate  there  was  no 
other  hill  like  it.  From  this  hill  overlooking  the  bay 
of  Montevideo  his  thoughts  passed  on  to  the  hill  of 
the  Uruguayan  national  emblem,  and  he  fell 
asleep. 

Every  night  the  breeze  off  the  sea  brought  a 
coolness  propitious  to  sleep.  He  was  never  wake- 
ful. He  loved  his  fiancee  completely,  but  it  had 
been  said  that  a  man  should  not  think  about 
women — above  all  when  they  are  not  there.  Life  in 
the  country  had  accustomed  him  to  chastity.  As 
for  this  other  business,  he  tried  to  think  as  little  as 
possible  about  the  man  he  hated.  The  din  of  the 
rain  on  the  flat  roof  kept  him  company. 

To  a  man  in  jail  or  to  a  blind  man,  time  flows 
downstream,  as  if  along  an  easy  slope.  Halfway 
through  his  reclusion,  Arredondo  experienced 
more  than  once  that  almost  timeless  time.  In  the 
first  of  the  house's  three  patios  there  was  a  cistern 
with  a  frog  in  it.  It  never  occurred  to  Arredondo 
to  think  that  the  frog's  time,  which  borders  on 
eternity,  was  what  he  himself  sought. 

When  the  date  was  not  far  off,-  his  impatience 
began  again.  One  night,  unable  to  bear  it  any 
longer,  he  went  out  into  the  street.  Everything 
seemed  different,  larger.  Turning  a  corner,  he 
saw  a  light  and  entered  a  saloon.  To  justify  his 
presence,  he  ordered  a  bitter  rum.  Some  soldiers, 
leaning  on  the  wooden  bar,  were  holding  forth. 

"You  know  it's  absolutely  forbidden  to  give  out 
news  of  battles,"  one  of  them  said.  "Listen  to  what 
happened  yesterday  evening.  This  will  amuse  you. 
A  few  of  us  were  passing  by  La  Razon,  when  we 
heard  a  voice  inside  defying  the  order.  Losing  no 
time,  we  marched  in.  The  office  was  pitch-dark, 


109 


but  we  riddled  with  bullets  whoever  was  doing  the 
talking.  We  wanted  to  drag  him  out  by  the  heels. 
When  it  was  quiet,  we  searched  the  place  for  him, 
but  what  we  found  was  one  of  those  machines  they 
call  a  phonograph,  which  speaks  by  itself." 

All  of  them  laughed.  "What  do  you  think  of  a 
dodge  like  that,  farmer?"  the  soldier  said  to  Ar- 
redondo,  who  had  been  eavesdropping.  Arre- 
dondo  kept  silent. 

The  uniformed  man  brought  his  face  close  to 
Arredondo's  and  said,  "Quick!  Let  me  hear  you 
shout,  'Long  live  the  president  of  our  country — 
Juan  Idiarte  Borda!'  " 

Arredondo  did  not  disobey,  and  amid  mocking 
applause  he  managed  to  reach  the  door.  He  was  in 
the  street  when  a  final  insult  was  hurled  at  him. 
"Fear's  no  fool,"  he  heard.  "It  kills  anger."  Ar- 
redondo had  behaved  like  a  coward,  but  he  knew 
he  was  not  one.  Slowly  he  made  his  way  back 
home. 

On  the  twenty-fifth  of  August,  Avelino  Ar- 
redondo woke  up  at  a  little  after  nine.  He  thought 
first  of  Clara  and  only  later  of  the  date.  "Goodbye 
to  waiting,"  he  told  himself  then,  relieved.  "To- 
day's the  day." 

He  shaved  without  hurrying,  and  in  the  mirror 
he  found  his  everyday  face.  He  chose  a  red  necktie 
and  put  on  his  best  clothes.  He  ate  a  late  lunch. 
The  overcast  sky  threatened  drizzle.  He  had 
always  imagined  the  sky  would  be  bright  and  blue. 
A  touch  of  sadness  came  over  him  as  he  left  his 
damp  room  for  the  last  time.  In  the  arched  en- 
tranceway  he  met  Clementina  and  gave  her  his  few 
remaining  pesos.  On  the  sign  over  the  hardware 
store  he  saw  the  colored  diamond  shapes,  meaning 


1  10 


paint  was  sold  there,  and  he  reflected  that  for 
over  two  months  he  had  not  given  them  a  thought. 
He  walked  toward  Sarandi  Street.  It  was  a  holiday 
and  very  few  people  were  about. 

The  clock  had  not  struck  three  when  he  reached 
the  Plaza  Matriz.  The  "Te  Deum"  was  already 
over.  A  group  of  dignitaries — government  of- 
ficials, Army  officers,  and  prelates — was  coming 
down  the  slow  steps  of  the  church.  At  first  sight, 
the  tall  hats — some  still  in  hand — the  uniforms, 
the  gold  braid,  the  arms,  and  the  tunics  created 
the  illusion  that  the  group  was  large;  in  reality, 
there  were  no  more  than  about  thirty  people.  Ar- 
redondo,  who  felt  no  fear,  was  filled  with  a  kind  of 
respect.  He  asked  someone  which  was  the  presi- 
dent. 

"You  see  the  archbishop,  with  his  miter  and  cro- 
sier— the  one  beside  him,"  he  was  told. 

Arredondo  drew  a  revolver  and  opened  fire. 
Idiarte  Borda  took  one  or  two  steps,  fell  headlong, 
and  said  distinctly,  "I've  been  shot!" 

Arredondo  gave  himself  up  to  the  authorities. 
Later  he  was  to  declare,  "I  am  a  Colorado,  a  Red, 
and  I  say  it  with  pride.  I've  killed  the  president, 
who  betrayed  and  tainted  our  party.  I  broke  with 
my  friends  and  my  fiancee,  so  as  not  to  implicate 
them.  I  did  not  look  at  the  newspapers,  so  that  no- 
body could  say  they  had  incited  me.  I  claim  this  act 
of  justice  as  my  own.  Now — let  me  be  judged." 

This  is  the  way  it  probably  happened,  although 
in  a  more  involved  fashion;  this  is  the  way  I  imag- 
ine it  happened.

The  Disk 


I  am  a  woodcutter.  My  name  does  not  matter.  The 
hut  where  I  was  born  and  where  I  shall  probably 
soon  die  stands  at  the  edge  of  the  forest. 

It  is  said  of  the  forest  that  it  stretches  as  far  as 
the  sea,  which  rings  the  whole  earth  and  on  which 
wooden  huts  like  mine  wend  their  way.  Never  hav- 
ing seen  this  sea,  I  don't  know.  Nor  have  I  ever 
seen  the  other  side  of  the  forest.  When  we  were 
boys  my  elder  brother  made  me  vow  that  between 
us  we  would  chop  down  the  entire  woods  until  not 
a  single  tree  was  left.  My  brother  died,  and  what  I 
seek  now — and  what  I  shall  go  on  seeking — is 
something  else.  To  the  west  runs  a  stream  that  I 
know  how  to  fish  with  my  hands.  In  the  forest 
there  are  wolves,  but  wolves  do  not  scare  me,  and 
my  axe  has  never  been  untrue  to  me. 

Of  my  years  I  have  never  kept  count.  I  know 
they  are  many.  My  eyes  no  longer  see.  In  the  vil- 
lage, where  I  venture  no  more,  since  I  would  lose 
my  way,  I  am  known  as  a  miser.  But  how  much 
treasure  can  a  mere  woodcutter  have  laid  up? 

To  keep  snow  out,  I  shut  tight  the  door  of  my 


1!3 


house  with  a  stone.  One  evening  long  ago,  I  heard 
labored  footsteps  approach,  and  then  a  knock.  I 
opened,  and  a  stranger  came  in.  He  was  old  and 
tall,  and  he  was  wrapped  in  a  threadbare  blanket. 
A  scar  marked  his  face.  His  years  seemed  to  have 
given  him  more  authority  than  frailty,  but  I  no- 
ticed that  he  was  unable  to  get  about  without  the 
aid  of  a  staff.  We  exchanged  a  few  words  that  I  no 
longer  remember.  At  the  end,  he  said,  "I  am 
homeless  and  sleep  wherever  I  can.  I  have  trav- 
eled the  length  and  breadth  of  this  land  of  the 
Saxons." 

These  words  testified  to  his  years.  My  father  had 
always  spoken  of  the  Saxon  land,  which  nowadays 
people  call  England. 

I  had  bread  and  fish.  We  did  not  speak  a  word 
during  the  meal.  Rain  began  to  fall.  With  a  few 
skins  I  made  him  a  pallet  on  the  earth  floor,  where 
my  brother  had  died.  When  night  fell,  we  went  to 
sleep. 

Day  was  dawning  when  we  left  the  hut.  The  rain 
had  stopped  and  the  ground  was  covered  with 
new-fallen  snow.  My  companion's  staff  slipped 
from  his  hand  and  he  ordered  me  to  pick  it  up. 

"Why  must  I  obey  you?"  I  asked  him. 

"Because  I  am  a  king,"  he  answered. 

I  thought  him  mad.  Picking  up  the  staff,  I 
handed  it  to  him.  He  spoke  with  a  different  voice. 

"I  am  king  of  the  Secgens,"  he  said.  "Often  in 
hard-pitched  battle  I  carried  my  people  to  victory, 
but  at  the  fateful  hour  I  lost  my  kingdom.  My 
name  is  Isern  and  I  am  of  the  race  of  Odin." 

"I  do  not  worship  Odin,"  I  said.  "I  worship 
Christ." 


114 


He  went  on  as  if  he  had  not  heard  me.  "I  travel 
the  paths  of  exile,  but  I  am  still  king,  for  I  have 
the  disk.  Do  you  want  to  see  it?" 

He  opened  the  palm  of  his  bony  hand.  There 
was  nothing  in  it.  Only  then  did  I  recall  that  he 
had  always  kept  the  hand  closed. 

Staring  hard  at  me,  he  said,  "You  may  touch  it." 

With  a  certain  misgiving,  I  touched  my  finger- 
tips to  his  palm.  I  felt  something  cold,  and  saw  a 
glitter.  The  hand  closed  abruptly.  I  said  nothing. 
The  man  went  on  patiently,  as  if  speaking  to  a 
child. 

"It  is  Odin's  disk,"  he  said,  "It  has  only  one  side. 
In  all  the  world  there  is  nothing  else  with  only  one 
side.  As  long  as  the  disk  remains  mine,  I  shall  be 
king." 

"Is  it  golden?"  I  said. 

"I  don't  know.  It  is  Odin's  disk  and  it  has  only 
one  side." 

Then  and  there  I  was  overcome  with  greed  to 
own  the  disk.  If  it  were  mine,  I  could  trade  it  for 
an  ingot  of  gold  and  I  would  be  a  king.  I  said  to 
the  vagabond,  whom  to  this  day  I  go  on  hating, 
"In  my  hut  I  have  buried  a  box  of  coins.  They  are 
of  gold  and  they  shine  like  an  axe.  If  you  give  me 
Odin's  disk,  I'll  trade  you  the  box." 

He  said  stubbornly,  "I  don't  want  to." 

"Then,"  I  said,  "you  may  continue  on  your 
path." 

He  turned  his  back  to  me.  One  blow  with  the 
axe  at  the  back  of  his  neck  was  more  than  enough 
to  bring  him  down,  but  as  he  fell  his  hand  opened, 
and  in  the  air  I  saw  the  glitter.  I  took  care  to  mark 
the  spot  with  my  axe,  and  dragged  the  dead  man 


"5 


to  the  stream,  which  was  running  high.  There  I 
threw  him  in. 

Coming  back  to  my  hut,  I  searched  for  the  disk. 
I  did  not  find  it.  That  was  years  ago,  and  I  am 
searching  still.

The  Book  of  Sand 


Thy  rope  of  sands  .   .    . 

— George  Herbert 


The  line  is  made  up  of  an  infinite  number  of 
points;  the  plane  of  an  infinite  number  of  lines; 
the  volume  of  an  infinite  number  of  planes;  the 
hypervolume  of  an  infinite  number  of  volumes. 
.  .  .  No,  unquestionably  this  is  not — more  geome- 
trico — the  best  way  of  beginning  my  story.  To 
claim  that  it  is  true  is  nowadays  the  convention  of 
every  made-up  story.  Mine,  however,  is  true. 

I  live  alone  in  a  fourth-floor  apartment  on  Bel- 
grano  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires.  Late  one  evening,  a 
few  months  back,  I  heard  a  knock  at  my  door.  I 
opened  it  and  a  stranger  stood  there.  He  was  a  tall 
man,  with  nondescript  features — or  perhaps  it  was 
my  myopia  that  made  them  seem  that  way. 
Dressed  in  gray  and  carrying  a  gray  suitcase  in  his 
hand,  he  had  an  unassuming  look  about  him.  I 
saw  at  once  that  he  was  a  foreigner.  At  first,  he 
struck  me  as  old;  only  later  did  I  realize  that  I  had 
been  misled  by  his  thin  blond  hair,  which  was,  in  a 
Scandinavian  sort  of  way,  almost  white.  During  the 
course  of  our  conversation,  which  was  not  to  last 
an  hour,  I  found  out  that  he  came  from  the  Ork- 
neys. 


117 


I  invited  him  in,  pointing  to  a  chair.  He  paused 
awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  ema- 
nated from  him — as  it  does  now  from  me. 

"I  sell  Bibles,"  he  said. 

Somewhat  pedantically,  I  replied,  "In  this  house 
are  several  English  Bibles,  including  the  first — 
John  Wiclif's.  I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's, 
Luther's — which,  from  a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the 
worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As  you 
see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of." 

After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said,  "I  don't 
only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came 
across  on  the  outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest 
you." 

He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the  book  on  a 
table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth. 
There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had  passed  through 
many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its 
unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words 
"Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay." 

"Nineteenth  century,  probably,"  I  remarked. 

"I  don't  know,"  he  said.  "I've  never  found  out." 

I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was 
strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and 
typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  col- 
umns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed, 
and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.  In  the  upper 
corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  no- 
ticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let 
us  say)  40,514  and  the  facing  right-hand  page  999. 
I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight 
digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind 
used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen 
and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand. 

It  was  at  this  point  that  the  stranger  said,  "Look 

118 


at  the  illustration  closely.  You'll  never  see  it  again." 

I  noted  my  place  and  closed  the  book.  At  once,  I 
reopened  it.  Page  by  page,  in  vain,  I  looked  for 
the  illustration  of  the  anchor.  "It  seems  to  be  a 
version  of  Scriptures  in  some  Indian  language,  is  it 
not?"  I  said  to  hide  my  dismay. 

"No,"  he  replied.  Then,  as  if  confiding  a  secret, 
he  lowered  his  voice.  "I  acquired  the  book  in  a 
town  out  on  the  plain  in  exchange  for  a  handful  of 
rupees  and  a  Bible.  Its  owner  did  not  know  how  to 
read.  I  srspect  that  he  saw  the  Book  of  Books  as  a 
talisman.  He  was  of  the  lowest  caste;  nobody  but 
other  untouchables  could  tread  his  shadow  with- 
out contamination.  He  told  me  his  book  was  called 
the  Book  of  Sand,  because  neither  the  book  nor 
the  sand  has  any  beginning  or  end." 

The  stranger  asked  me  to  find  the  first  page. 

I  laid  my  left  hand  on  the  cover  and,  trying  to 
put  my  thumb  on  the  flyleaf,  I  opened  the  book.  It 
was  useless.  Every  time  I  tried,  a  number  of  pages 
came  between  the  cover  and  my  thumb.  It  was  as 
if  they  kept  growing  from  the  book. 

"Now  find  the  last  page." 

Again  I  failed.  In  a  voice  that  was  not  mine,  I 
barely  managed  to  stammer,  "This  can't  be." 

Still  speaking  in  a  low  voice,  the  stranger  said, 
"It  can't  be,  but  it  is.  The  number  of  pages  in  this 
book  is  no  more  or  less  than  infinite.  None  is  the 
first  page,  none  the  last.  I  don't  know  why  they're 
numbered  in  this  arbitrary  way.  Perhaps  to 
suggest  that  the  terms  of  an  infinite  series  admit 
any  number." 

Then,  as  if  he  were  thinking  aloud,  he  said,  "If 
space  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  space. 
If  time  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  time." 


•'9 


His  speculations  irritated  me.  "You  are  re- 
ligious, no  doubt?"  I  asked  him. 

"Yes,  I'm  a  Presbyterian.  My  conscience  is  clear. 
I  am  reasonably  sure  of  not  having  cheated  the  na- 
tive when  I  gave  him  the  Word  of  God  in  ex- 
change for  his  devilish  book." 

I  assured  him  that  he  had  nothing  to  reproach 
himself  for,  and  I  asked  if  he  were  just  passing 
through  this  part  of  the  world.  He  replied  that  he 
planned  to  return  to  his  country  in  a  few  days.  It 
was  then  that  I  learned  that  he  was  a  Scot  from  the 
Orkney  Islands.  I  told  him  I  had  a  great  personal 
affection  for  Scotland,  through  my  love  of  Steven- 
son and  Hume. 

"You  mean  Stevenson  and  Robbie  Burns,"  he 
corrected. 

While  we  spoke,  I  kept  exploring  the  infinite 
book.  With  feigned  indifference,  I  asked,  "Do  you 
intend  to  offer  this  curiosity  to  the  British  Mu- 
seum?" 

"No.  I'm  offering  it  to  you,"  he  said,  and  he 
stipulated  a  rather  high  sum  for  the  book. 

I  answered,  in  all  truthfulness,  that  such  a  sum 
was  out  of  my  reach,  and  I  began  thinking.  After  a 
minute  or  two,  I  came  up  with  a  scheme. 

"I  propose  a  swap,"  I  said.  "You  got  this  book 
for  a  handful  of  rupees  and  a  copy  of  the  Bible. 
I'll  offer  you  the  amount  of  my  pension  check, 
which  I've  just  collected,  and  my  black-letter  Wiclif 
Bible.  I  inherited  it  from  my  ancestors." 

"A  black-letter  Wiclif!"  he  murmured. 

I  went  to  my  bedroom  and  brought  him  the 
money  and  the  book.  He  turned  the  leaves  and 
studied  the  title  page  with  all  the  fervor  of  a  true 
bibliophile. 


120 


"It's  a  deal,"  he  said. 

It  amazed  me  that  he  did  not  haggle.  Only  later 
was  I  to  realize  that  he  had  entered  my  house  with 
his  mind  made  up  to  sell  the  book.  Without  count- 
ing the  money,  he  put  it  away. 

We  talked  about  India,  about  Orkney,  and 
about  the  Norwegian  jails  who  once  ruled  it.  It 
was  night  when  the  man  left.  I  have  not  seen  him 
again,  nor  do  I  know  his  name. 

I  thought  of  keeping  the  Book  of  Sand  in  the 
space  left  on  the  shelf  by  the  Wiclif,  but  in  the  end 
I  decided  to  hide  it  behind  the  volumes  of  a  bro- 
ken set  of  The  Thousand  and  One  Nights.  I  went 
to  bed  and  did  not  sleep.  At  three  or  four  in  the 
morning,  I  turned  on  the  light.  I  got  down  the  im- 
possible book  and  leafed  through  its  pages.  On 
one  of  them  I  saw  engraved  a  mask.  The  upper 
corner  of  the  page  carried  a  number,  which  I  no 
longer  recall,  elevated  to  the  ninth  power. 

I  showed  no  one  my  treasure.  To  the  luck  of 
owning  it  was  added  the  fear  of  having  it  stolen, 
and  then  the  misgiving  that  it  might  not  truly  be 
infinite.  These  twin  preoccupations  intensified  my 
old  misanthropy.  I  had  only  a  few  friends  left;  I 
now  stopped  seeing  even  them.  A  prisoner  of  the 
book,  I  almost  never  went  out  anymore.  After 
studying  its  frayed  spine  and  covers  with  a  magni- 
fying glass,  I  rejected  the  possibility  of  a  contriv- 
ance of  any  sort.  The  small  illustrations,  I  verified, 
came  two  thousand  pages  apart.  I  set  about  listing 
them  alphabetically  in  a  notebook,  which  I  was  not 
long  in  filling  up.  Never  once  was  an  illustration 
repeated.  At  night,  in  the  meager  intervals  my  in- 
somnia granted,  I  dreamed  of  the  book. 

Summer  came  and  went,  and  I  realized  that  the 


book  was  monstrous.  What  good  did  it  do  me  to 
think  that  I,  who  looked  upon  the  volume  with  my 
eyes,  who  held  it  in  my  hands,  was  any  less  mon- 
strous? I  felt  that  the  book  was  a  nightmarish  ob- 
ject, an  obscene  thing  that  affronted  and  tainted 
reality  itself. 

I  thought  of  fire,  but  I  feared  that  the  burning 
of  an  infinite  book  might  likewise  prove  infinite 
and  suffocate  the  planet  with  smoke.  Somewhere  I 
recalled  reading  that  the  best  place  to  hide  a  leaf  is 
in  a  forest.  Before  retirement,  I  worked  on  Mexico 
Street,  at  the  Argentine  National  Library,  which 
contains  nine  hundred  thousand  volumes.  I  knew 
that  to  the  right  of  the  entrance  a  curved  staircase 
leads  down  into  the  basement,  where  books  and 
maps  and  periodicals  are  kept.  One  day  I  went 
there  and,  slipping  past  a  member  of  the  staff  and 
trying  not  to  notice  at  what  height  or  distance 
from  the  door,  I  lost  the  Book  of  Sand  on  one  of 
the  basement's  musty  shelves.

Afterword 


Prefacing  stories  a  reader  has  not  yet  read,  since  it 
demands  the  analysis  of  plots  that  it  may  be  incon- 
venient to  deal  with  in  advance,  is  a  somewhat  im- 
possible task.  I  therefore  prefer  an  afterword. 

The  book's  first  story  takes  up  the  old  theme  of 
the  double,  which  several  times  moved  Robert 
Louis  Stevenson's  ever-fortunate  pen.  In  England, 
its  name  is  "fetch"  or,  more  bookishly,  "wraith  of 
the  living";  in  Germany,  "Doppelganger."  One  of  its 
earliest  names,  I  suspect,  was  "alter  ego."  This 
ghostly  apparition  probably  came  from  mirrors  of 
metal  or  from  reflections  in  water  or  simply  from 
memory,  which  makes  of  anyone  both  a  spectator 
and  an  actor.  In  "The  Other,"  I  had  to  ensure  that 
the  speakers  were  sufficiently  different  to  be  two 
persons  and  alike  enough  to  be  one.  Is  it  worth 
stating  that  the  idea  for  the  story  came  to  me  in 
Cambridge  on  the  banks  of  the  Charles  River, 
whose  cold  course  reminded  me  of  the  far-off 
course  of  the  Rhone? 

The  theme  of  love  is  quite  common  in  my 
poems  but  not  in  my  prose,  which  offers  no  other 


123 


example  than  "Ulrike."  The  reader  will  notice  its 
formal  affinity  with  "The  Other." 

"The  Congress"  is  perhaps  the  most  ambitious 
of  the  tales  in  this  book;  its  subject  is  that  of  an  en- 
terprise so  vast  that  in  the  end  it  becomes  con- 
fused with  the  world  itself  and  with  the  sum  of 
daily  life.  Its  opaque  beginning  tries  to  imitate  that 
of  a  Kafka  story;  its  end  tries,  doubtless  in  vain,  to 
match  the  ecstasies  of  Chesterton  and  John  Bun- 
yan.  I  have  never  been  worthy  of  such  a  revela- 
tion, but  I  have  managed  to  dream  one  up.  I  have 
woven  into  the  story — as  is  my  habit — a  number  of 
autobiographical  elements. 

Life,  which  everyone  knows  is  inscrutable,  left 
me  no  peace  until  I  perpetrated  a  posthumous 
story  by  H.  P.  Lovecraft,  a  writer  whom  I  have 
always  considered  an  unconscious  parodist  of  Poe. 
In  the  end,  I  gave  in;  the  lamentable  fruit  is  en- 
titled "There  Are  More  Things." 

"The  Sect  of  the  Thirty"  salvages,  without  a 
shred  of  documentation,  the  tale  of  a  possible 
heresy. 

"The  Night  of  the  Gifts"  is  perhaps  the  most  in- 
nocent, most  violent,  and  most  exalted  story  of- 
fered by  this  collection. 

An  earlier  story  of  mine,  "The  Lottery  of  Babel" 
(1941),  imagines  an  infinite  number  of  books; 
"Undr"  and  "The  Mirror  and  the  Mask,"  cen- 
turies-old literatures  that  are  made  up  of  a  single 
line  or  word. 

"Utopia  of  a  Tired  Man"  is  in  my  judgment  the 
most  honest  and  melancholy  piece  in  the  collec- 
tion. 

I  have  always  been  amazed  by  the  ethical  obses- 


124 


sion  of  Americans.  "The  Bribe"  attempts  to  reflect 
this  trait. 

In  spite  of  John  Felton,  Charlotte  Corday,  the 
well-known  opinion  of  Rivera  Indarte  ("It  is  a  holy 
act  to  kill  Rosas"),  and  the  Uruguayan  National 
Anthem  ("If  they  are  tyrants,  Brutus'  dagger"),  I 
do  not  approve  of  political  assassination.  Be  that  as 
it  may,  readers  of  Avelino  Arredondo's  solitary 
crime  might  wish  to  know  the  story's  outcome. 
The  historian  Luis  Melian  Lafinur  asked  for  Ar- 
redondo's pardon,  but  his  judges  Carlos  Fein  and 
Cristobal  Salvanach  sentenced  him  to  a  month  in 
solitary  confinement  and  five  years'  imprisonment. 
One  of  the  streets  of  Montevideo  now  bears  Ar- 
redondo's name. 

Two  opposite  and  inconceivable  concepts  are 
the  subjects  of  the  last  two  stories.  "The  Disk"  is 
about  the  Euclidean  circle,  which  has  only  one 
side;  "The  Book  of  Sand,"  a  volume  of  incalcula- 
ble pages. 

I  hope  that  these  hasty  notes  I  have  just  dictated 
do  not  exhaust  this  book  and  that  its  dreams  go  on 
branching  out  in  the  hospitable  imagination  of 
those  who  now  close  it.
